Then the five other legislative proposals are on the line, following the unlocking of the European company texts: the three twin statutes for cooperatives, mutual societies and associations and the draft directives on trans-national mergers and transfers of the registered offices of companies from one Member State to another.
All of these instruments will require the same kind of provisions as the ones found in European companies.
This is another reason for waiting a short while before launching the revision of the European Works Council Directive, which, incidentally, will have much to gain from the debates held on these other dossiers.
They will inevitably inspire and facilitate the acceptance of the solutions which will be on the table for discussion when we turn to the task.
Finally, I know that there is concern in this House about information and consultation of employees in the context of mergers and acquisitions control.
As you know, from previous speeches, we are holding a debate within the Commission on how better to address this concern.
Under the merger regulation, workers and representatives are already entitled in some cases to be auditioned by the Commission's services, which conduct an inquiry on the conformity of a merger with the Treaty.
Our idea consists in making these auditions more systematic.
On the other hand, we could usefully remind merging companies of their responsibilities and obligations with regard to worker information and consultation on these operations which very frequently affect them.
As social cohesion is now top priority for Europe, public authorities can no longer be expected to be solely and wholly responsible for it.
Like every other part of society, businesses are expected to undertake their share.
Promoting corporate social responsibility is now an essential part of the European strategy for social cohesion.
The guiding principle of corporate social responsibility for companies is to be competitive and profitable by living up to their social responsibilities.
In response to the Lisbon Council's appeal to companies' corporate sense of social responsibility the Commission has included this theme in its own social policy agenda published in June 2000 by stressing its importance in addressing the employment and social consequences of economic and market integration and adapting worker conditions in the new economy.
It has announced a communication to support initiatives related to corporate social responsibility and management of change.
The Commission will issue a Green Paper this year to facilitate further development towards a framework for corporate social responsibility practice at European level.
In conclusion, it is the combination of the different lines of action which I mentioned to you, as well as adequate action from public authorities, private organisations, companies, workers and the social partners at all levels, that will allow us to deal properly with the social implications of industrial change and corporate restructuring.
All of them are important, all of them require an innovative and open attitude on the part of policy makers.
I know that is your stance on this and I thank you for your support.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have to inform you that I have received a motion for a resolution under Rule 37 paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
The vote on this motion will take place on Thursday.
Mr President, this is never the most gratifying moment to make speeches of this kind.
I am delighted with the Commissioner' s response.
I think we will find that it contains all kinds of points worth acting on - particularly if we give it another good read through - in order to reach the goals we are seeking to achieve through these questions, and find the necessary solutions.
Whenever restructuring takes place there is a debate as to whether our institutions are sufficiently well-designed to cope with such eventualities.
That is quite logical.
Indeed the Treaty on the European Union, specifically Article 136, bestows this task on the European Union.
Needless to say, we must tread a fine line, i.e. the companies concerned must be given as much leeway as possible to make their own policy decisions, and so promote commercial growth of their operations, which will help to combat long-term and structural unemployment in Europe.
On the other hand, we have a moral duty to engage in consultation.
Volkswagen in Germany is a good case in point.
If these consultation obligations are properly observed, then it is far easier to resolve a particular structural problem than were this not to be the case.
If you compare the restructuring of Volkswagen with restructuring operations now taking place in other European countries, which do not have such a good record when it comes to observing consultation obligations, then the differences are plain for all to see.
That is why it is so very important for these consultation obligations to be included in the agenda as soon as possible, and for the matter to be resolved, preferably within the term of the Swedish Presidency.
That is what we aim to achieve with these questions.
Mr Rocard was right in saying that the resolution was submitted on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Having said that, we still need a number of amendments, precisely in order to underline the point that companies must be given as much leeway as possible to make their own policy decisions.
Of course, that is what the resolution implies, but the point is not made quite as clearly as we would wish.
So we will go along with the resolution, but only if it includes the amendments we have yet to put forward. Obviously we still have up to Thursday to discuss this.
Mr President, on this side of the House we are not trying to stop restructuring but we want it to be done in a socially responsible way.
We want a pro-active approach to industrial restructuring and change.
We want to see a corporate code of social responsibility but we can see that this will be achieved only when we have an updated and completed legal framework in this area.
We want to see true partnership at work and the real benefits that this can bring to the European Union.
But the latest spate of restructuring in the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union shows that we are far from achieving those things.
To the Corus workers in the north-east of England or Wales, to the Vauxhall workers in Luton - or, for that matter, the Danone workers in France and Holland - the idea of a corporate code of responsibility - as I said in an earlier debate - is a sick joke, quite frankly.
The promise of a Green Paper in the middle of this year is not an adequate response to the anguish that those workers, their families and entire communities have felt.
We want to see a review of the law on collective redundancies, a review on transfers, a review of the European Works Council Directive, to make sure it is a directive that is observed rather than being systematically avoided by business.
We also want to see the general framework on information and consultation adopted as a matter of urgency.
This is absolutely essential if we are going to introduce an ongoing day-by-day flow of consultation and information and, in that way, build a true partnership at work: a partnership that can deliver improved innovation, competitiveness and productivity.
We want to see that true partnership.
We are tired of the linkage of various directives in this package, with the excuse that we cannot look for a review of the European Works Council Directive until it has been further bedded-in and the European company statute is in place.
Yes, we need to establish linkage, but in taking this package now and taking a holistic approach to the need to improve information and consultation for workers.
We believe that if this framework of legislation can be updated in this way, coupled with the new observatory on industrial change, it can give us the tools for a more pro-active approach to industrial change within the European Union.
I would also like to make an appeal to the Liberal Group.
We were given a mandate by this House in January to look at this issue of restructuring in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We have done that.
We have come up with an oral question and a resolution in a spirit of cooperation.
I would ask the Liberals, in the spirit of cooperation, to withdraw their highly destructive resolution.
It would be helpful.
Mr President, unfortunately it is very timely that we should be discussing these issues today in the light of current examples of restructuring.
As has been mentioned earlier, the Anglo-Dutch company Corus - the steel company - is a classic example of a company making decisions based on profit with no regard to the disastrous social costs of its actions.
Corus has just announced total job losses of 6 000 in the UK - nearly 3 000 in my own constituency in Wales.
Despite months of speculation over possible plant closures the company was unwilling to reveal its future plans to the government, let alone to its own workforce, until the formal announcement was made on 1 February.
There was no prior consultation with the workforce, although since announcing the decision the company has been holding what it calls "consultation".
There is speculation that Danone, a profitable company, is to shed 3 000 jobs in Europe.
Again there has been no consultation with the workers and no discussion about alternative ways forward.
That is why it is so important to adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers without delay, together with a review of the European Works Council Directive and the Collective Redundancies Directive, which incidentally proved to offer so little protection to the Corus workers in my constituency.
Companies cannot be free to wreak such havoc on people's lives and communities.
There is a positive framework of controls and sanctions which we can use.
We must make sure they are effective.
Mr President, faced with massive mergers and industrial restructuring resulting in thousands of redundancies, many employees, many European citizens, have found Europe to be powerless if not actually colluding with these actions, in line with the law of free competition.
It is high time that we provided means to intervene on behalf of employees.
There is an intolerable contradiction between the Council and the Commission' s declared priority of promoting employment and the massive redundancies that big businesses are making, and who are, at the same time, making fantastic profits.
Michelin, Moulinex, Danone and Alstom are not businesses experiencing difficulties.
They are perfectly competitive, and have a record of making more than adequate profits, but they are laying off thousands of people nonetheless.
The case of Danone is very instructive, making 3 000 people redundant in Europe and 1 700 in France.
In the year 2000, this firm' s European installations made a net profit of EUR 795 million, or 17% more than in 1999.
It is not possible to sit back and simply watch the unfolding spectacle of mergers that make men and women redundant, plunging entire families into chaos.
The European citizenship we so often refer to in this society will continue to be nothing more than just so much hot air as long as employees are not properly informed and consulted on choices which determine their own future and that of their region and their country.
How, furthermore, can we find it acceptable for groups to benefit from grants of public financial aid to promote employment without being obliged to comply with the commitments they have made?
In such instances, the aid funds should be paid back to the community which will have to bear the social costs resulting from the choice of financial profitability over employment.
I do not think that the problem boils down to employability or adaptability or to simply dealing with the social fallout, as the Commissioner suggested.
I therefore endorsed the proposals made in the resolution as well as the amendments that clarify and strengthen certain aspects.
We shall have to go much further to respond to the democratic demands of the working citizens of Europe.
I therefore feel that rights should be developed to the point where it is possible to halt scheduled redundancies and ongoing mergers.
Any merger contract must include social clauses.
Penalties must also be introduced for failure to comply with the directives on worker consultation.
At this time when there is a great deal of debate on the subject of European identity and the direction that European integration should be taking, I feel that a text specifying certain employee rights in the face of financial objectives would be the least that could be done so as to give the European Union a degree of credibility.
I shall therefore vote in favour of the resolution which I hope will be enhanced by a number of amendments.
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
Since it is now time for the vote, the debate is now suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
In order to justify European aid, the rapporteurs emphasise the difficult economic situation in Cambodia and Laos and the performance of the bomb disposal programmes that are essential after many years of conflict in this region, while carefully avoiding pointing out, in both instances, the significant responsibility of the imperialist powers, including France and the United States.
If this were simply European aid, pure and simple, paid as reparation for years of looting and destroying these two countries, without any form of recompense, then it would have our support.
However, this so-called aid is no more than a flimsy screen designed to conceal the goals which are revealed, nonetheless, in the phrase about turning around the downward trend of European Community exports to this region of the world, or, to put it in plain terms, enabling the predators in the shape of major European businesses to conduct, and intensify as far as possible, what is effectively still a policy of plundering this region of the world.
We have therefore abstained from voting on these reports.
Dover report (A5-002/2001)
The United Kingdom had obtained a derogation of the regulations on maximum hours of work and on night work of adolescents.
The Commission, and this report, now propose waiving this derogation.
We might have been able to welcome seeing the United Kingdom apply rules granting young people in work greater protection.
The fact is, however, that the perfect agreement that has been reached between conservatives, Labour Party members, liberals and socialists, on the end of this derogation period is based on the fact that, as the report itself says, "the possibilities for derogation [are] sufficient in order to provide the necessary flexibility" and this will not therefore have "adverse effects on employment opportunities for young people" .
This clearly demonstrates the fact not only that this regulation of the European institutions may be sidestepped, but that, even when it is applied, it does not protect youths from employers' thirst for profits.
We have voted against this report.
Unfortunately, the young workers of Britain are not likely to see a great improvement in their situation as a result of our adopting this resolution.
The directive will not meet the needs of young workers any better just because we have put an end to the scandal of this derogation for the English (as the United Kingdom did not fully comply with the directive limiting the work of children and adolescents).
This debate should, instead, have provided an opportunity to amend the directive to remove all the derogations it contains, which prevent it from being properly effective.
There is no justification for authorising young people of 14 and even 13 years of age to work in any way whatsoever [Article 4(2c)], outside compulsory school attendance [Article 8(1b)] and during school holidays [Article 8(1c)].
Nor is there any justification for the derogations allowing young people of less than 18 years of age to work more than 40 hours per week, over 8 hours per day [Article 8(5)], and do night work [Article 9(2)].
There is no justification for applying any restriction to application of the directive in the case of domestic service in a private household or to work in a family undertaking [Article 2(2)].
There is no point in denouncing child labour in Africa or Asia if we do not protect our own young people against economic exploitation and work that is harmful to health, safety and development and if we do not ensure that they receive training leading to qualifications in a system quite separate from that of the employers.
I wholeheartedly support this report by Mr Dover which aims to improve working conditions for young people in Britain.
It supports the view that the UK falls into line with a 1994 directive which limits the working hours of young people to eight hours a day or 40 hours a week and bans night work, although it provides for exceptions in special circumstances and for certain kinds of work.
Employment, particularly youth employment, is of course extremely important for both our young people and our economy.
We must not do anything to harm the job prospects of young people in Britain.
Sometimes, however, employers take advantage of our young workers and force them to work unnecessarily long hours.
Long hours and difficult working conditions are extremely dangerous and can be harmful to the health and productivity of our young people.
It is therefore vital that working hours are monitored and that employers are prevented from exploiting youngsters at work.
Exploitation is harmful and irresponsible.
We must act to curb it and ensure that our young people are protected from exploitation and its destructive effects by hard-pressed or greedy employers.
The legislation for reducing the working hours for young people already exists.
We just need to make sure that it is used.
The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of these measures.
I find it ironic that the Tories who constantly argue against Brussels bureaucrats interfering and who opposed this legislation, do in fact support this report on social policy.
This illustrates their totally schizophrenic attitude towards Europe.
The Labour Government is at the forefront of providing jobs for our young people and also measures to protect them at work.
I strongly urge the House to show its support for the protection of young people in Britain and to vote in favour of this report.
Savary report (A5-0016/2001)
Mr President, I voted for this report, which seeks to promote railway infrastructure in Europe.
A European rail system is an important goal for Europe.
Before I left to come to Strasbourg, some pensioners urged me to vote for the report tabled by the committee chaired by Mr Hatzidakis, saying: "We want to travel throughout Europe by train and we want to travel in luxury.
We would like there to be sofas, bars, high quality restaurants and televisions on trains.
Europe can and must provide us with this as well.
We are sure that Mr Hatzidakis will make it possible."
Mr President, with the imminent accession of the Central and Eastern European countries to the Union, an efficient rail transport network is becoming more and more crucial to smooth cross-border rail transport, which is why we need to integrate the national networks into a single European network.
Ironing out differences in the specifications used by individual railway undertakings is an important step towards a trans-European network.
Creating transport connections and removing traffic bottlenecks in less favoured or remote regions is another important step.
Developing the infrastructure will also give these regions a chance to participate in and profit from the internal market.
I am very pleased to welcome the report by Gilles Savary on the interoperability of the rail system, since it approves the common position of the Council without amendments.
This common position incorporates 33 of the 46 amendments put forward at first reading.
Like the rapporteur, I think the future of the European transport system necessarily involves revitalising the rail sector.
As we have often had cause to point out, within the European Union, investments in railways are differentiated to a great extent on a national basis.
It goes without saying that these national disparities represent a considerable obstacle to the development of rail transport in Europe, despite the many advantages offered by this less polluting form of transport.
At the same time, the establishment of the internal market has brought about a considerable increase in the movement of goods and persons around the European Union.
This increase has mainly benefited the road sector, particular as regards freight movement.
There are many reasons for the decline in the railways.
One reason is that rail has been organised on individual national lines.
There is no single market for railway services within the Community.
Moreover, the networks are not always terribly well suited to new patterns in the organisation of economic activities and urbanisation, or indeed to the changes that these have entailed in traffic flows.
Having said that, it is clear that the future of the European transport system necessarily involves revitalising the rail sector and in short order.
I am speaking in favour of this because I believe that rail has a key role to play in solving the mobility problems facing the European Union.
On a daily basis, the citizens of Europe suffer from pollution, congestion and the risk of accidents as a result of an excessive dependence on roads, a dependence that has only been exacerbated in the course of the last thirty years.
The objective of sustainable mobility is thus closely linked to revitalising the railways.
I am pleased, moreover, that the European Parliament has succeeded in getting through some amendments, which seek to have important social standards taken into greater consideration, such as vocational qualifications and conditions of health and safety at work.
The Council also took note of a number of sensitive areas, such as, for instance, the protection of the existing railway system, the need to adopt a system of exemptions or specific cases, such as the situation of some countries that are isolated from the rest of the Community, or the difference in track gauges.
Similarly, the Council has put forward a realistic common position that draws up a gradual schedule for work and takes account of the problems which enlargement will present for the rail sector.
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Savary report.
We shall vote in favour of this report since it is important to promote the interoperability of the trans-European rail system.
The road transport network is currently saturated and in need of an overhaul.
We must also undertake procedures to increase rail transport in order to relieve the pressure on the roads.
Yet, behind the laudable objectives of the rapporteur in terms of revitalising the railway sector, we see the spectre of liberalisation, since another objective of this report is to contribute towards opening up of markets in transport services and equipment assets and towards promoting the competitiveness of the rail sector as a whole.
We must express our grave reservations on this count, since we remain steadfastly opposed to liberalisation.
If the intention is indeed to create a solution that is a real alternative to road transport taking over everything, then there must be harmonisation of the disparate rail transport infrastructures in Europe.
In this respect I am forced to agree with the rapporteur.
Furthermore, I feel that incorporating social standards, vocational qualifications and health and safety and working conditions in the process of creating a trans-European rail system would be the very least we could do.
However, I shall be extremely vigilant in ensuring that harmonisation is carried out on the basis of the best existing social rights and not at the expense of users and employees in this sector.
There is, however, a dangerous failure to address one question: in what context is network interoperability to be achieved?
In the context of public services coordinated throughout Europe, which are guarantors of jobs and safety, or in the context of a market which has been sacrificed to competition and profit?
The three directives in the railway package recently adopted by Parliament and the Council would suggest that Europe sees the future of trans-European rail transport in the second of these.
Van Dam report (A5-0037/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for the van Dam report on the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers. And why is that?
This time, I took the advice of Mr Fatuzzo the sailor.
I say "sailor", Mr President, because you may not be aware that I nearly made ships my career. I might even have worked on bulk carriers.
Therefore, my potential colleague, Mr Fatuzzo the sailor, the man I am not but could have been, said to me: "I have been sailing for many years on bulk carriers.
I have read the report seeking to prevent ships sinking but, in my opinion, Mr Fatuzzo the MEP, ships sink because they are too old.
Old, unusable ships need to retire. This would make sailing safer."
I do not know whether to thank the MEP or the sailor.
There are other types of merchant vessel, apart from the oil tankers in the news, which are in a deplorable condition.
The consequences are perhaps not as spectacular as those of wrecked oil tankers, but the human death toll is far worse, when it is known that 146 bulk carriers have sunk in 10 years and that 780 crew members thereby lost their lives.
In voting for this report, we voted in favour of practical measures contributing to stepping up the safety of bulk carriers and their crews.
We must, however, point out the contradiction that exists between the concerns for safety and the concerns relating to what the report terms the risk of "distortions of competition" for European ports and terminals.
Safety is inevitably sacrificed in the attempt to safeguard the profits of shipowners and contractors.
It is a good idea to give the master the option of objecting to loading or unloading operation he considers might endanger the safety of his crew or ship.
However, it would be hypocritical to disregard the fact that the laws of competition and of the market (including the labour market) imposed by the shipowners and contractors are such that the master' s theoretical option of objecting does not carry much weight in the face of the means available to the capitalist forces in maritime transport to impose dangerous, and occasionally lethal, conditions on navigation and on living on board ships.
In 10 years, almost 150 bulk carriers have sunk, causing 800 deaths.
This is the tragic record of a sector which has been abandoned to the laws of competition and the market.
Like the rapporteur, I consider that the physical condition of the ships and the incompetence of the crew are the chief factors behind these wrecks.
So, in the first place, we have to do something about inspecting these ships, their crews and shipboard working and living conditions.
I therefore support any binding measures to improve safety standards, port State inspections and to ensure that loading and unloading terminals and masters are aware of their responsibilities.
For that, however, we have to set aside human and financial resources to actually implement the legislation in the Member States, particularly by increasing the number of inspectors.
Moreover, if we are to tackle the impunity from prosecution and leniency which prevail in maritime transport then we also have to drive home the message that shippers and shipowners are responsible too, if necessary by providing ourselves with the means to enforce judicial and financial penalties.
I shall vote in favour of all the proposals to that end.
Bakopoulos report (A5-0031/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Since it is on safety at sea, I could not fail to vote in favour of Mr Bakopoulos' report too, concerning the establishment of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution by Ships.
This time, Mr President, I communicated via e-mail with one of my former bosses who worked on the ships on which I travelled between New York and the Bahamas when, at 21 years old, before entering political life, I worked as a sailor, as I said before.
This gentleman, who has become a purser - his name is Augusto Fazio - said to me: "Well done. The European Parliament is right to concern itself with the safety of the sea and to prevent it becoming polluted.
But are you also concerning yourselves with the safety of us sailors who work on the ships?"
"Of course," I said. "Be patient.
There will also be reports dealing with your safety as well."
The proposal by Mr Bakopoulos, the rapporteur, to set up a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution by Ships, which would replace the current committees, is another step towards the renationalisation of Community policy on maritime safety, but is also an extra asset for improving monitoring of the implementation of Community and international regulations.
However, the recent disasters involving the Erika and Ievoli Sun vessels have shown that the even best resolutions are worthless unless we provide ourselves with the means to apply them and to have them applied.
That is why the legislation currently under discussion must be imposed on Member States, particularly legislation that governs prevention of pollution, monitoring the criteria regarding the training and formal qualifications of seafarers and working conditions at sea.
In order to do this, we must allocate resources to ensure the quantity and quality of inspections and inspectors, and in terms of making all concerned such as shipowners, charterers, tankers and classification societies responsible in financial terms.
In order to curb the impunity and complacency that pervade this industry, I voted in favour of this report.
Nicholson report (A5-0042/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, my name is Fatuzzo and the Italian for cod is "merluzzo"!
I will now give the interpreters a few moments to translate this profound, important connection into the other languages.
Today is 13 February, Mr President, and tomorrow is the day dedicated to lovers.
How could I fail to appreciate the European Parliament's impeccable timing in, the day before Valentine's Day, concerning itself with cod which make love in the Irish Sea, and producing a directive banning the fishing of cod between tomorrow, 14 February, Valentine's Day, and 30 April, precisely in order to allow them to reproduce?
In my opinion, with regard to respect for fish and cod, the European Parliament has done well.
Here's to Saint Valentine and here's to all lovers!
And here's to the cod as well!
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.36 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Industrial restructuring and mergers (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the oral question (B5-0008/2001) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to the Commission, on Community initiatives relating to the social consequences of industrial restructuring and mergers.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has enabled us to take a great step towards the reconstruction of a Europe of the citizens; this is what Mr Méndez de Vigo likes to tell us; this is what we have heard on many occasions from Professor Rodríguez Bereijo, the representative named by the Head of the Spanish Government, Mr José María Aznar, for the convention drafting the Charter.
And I believe that this is to the liking of the Europeans.
To build, through this long process, a social Europe seems to me to be a great challenge and a great opportunity, which must be taken advantage of.
But this construction is taking place at a specific moment, in particular economic, social and political circumstances.
The Lisbon Summit decided to liberalise the telecommunications, gas, electricity and transport markets.
We are experiencing a process of general globalisation and a change in the concept of industrial society and the labour market.
We may ask ourselves: and what about the human factor?
Both Nice and the social agenda agreed at that meeting highlight the need to count on the workers in management changes and combine the security and flexibility of economic growth with labour relations and the consequences for the social environment.
And that is why, within the globalising dimension, we cannot ignore the importance of certain companies in certain regions and areas, for example the outlying regions, such as Galicia, where I come from myself, where they are the only or the main source of employment and where the threat of globalisation without guarantees would make families worried and nervous.
Secondly, economic competitiveness and a healthy society must not be contradictory terms but rather harmonious ones.
Thirdly, industrial restructuring, to use the expression in a broad sense, which is perhaps acceptable and inevitable from an economic point of view, cannot ignore the social consequences of that restructuring, which must be prepared for, since the objective of Community economic policies and measures must be to achieve a high level of employment.
Fourthly and lastly, national Community aid, tax incentives etc. should be conditional upon long-term temporary binding commitments in the field of employment and local and regional development.
These four points are only some of the considerations that the Commission and the Council must take into account in the face of the phenomenon of industrial restructuring.
Of course, the participation of the works committees, the representatives of the workers, is expected.
Mr President, globalisation reduces economic distances.
We must commit ourselves to preventing it from increasing social differences.
Mr President, Commissioner, the cases of industrial restructuring which are most traumatic, because they are unforeseeable, are those dictated by aggressive, acquisitions-seeking behaviour in the market.
Much has been said about the lack of technical adaptation and market trends, but the extent of their social consequences is never considered.
Do we know how much they have contributed to the impoverishment of people and regions?
Do we know how those that suffer from them recover from depression and at what cost?
Do we know in what way and how much these factors contribute to the long-term unemployment of people over the age of forty?
Do we know in what way and how much these factors contribute to the fact that the true retirement age in the European Union is between fifty-five and fifty-seven?
The Lisbon resolutions were designed to respond to these points by giving priority to employment, to the viability of social protection, to combating social exclusion and also by preventing changes to the economy.
We do not know how much these approaches are contributing to increasing social security costs and we do not know how many people are becoming more dependent on systems of social protection.
Who is it that ultimately pays for social restructuring?
Is it the market or the taxpayer and the working person?
Prevention and fair, balanced change are impossible. The social partners say so and have even just signed a pre-agreement document in order to implement the directive on European society concerning information and consultation.
Commissioner, we have also heard it said that the market is not governed by the laws of nature and that the political authorities should act by means of legislation, institutional action and social dialogue.
Social insecurity and the increase in crime are becoming part of post-industrial society and affect both traditional sectors and the so-called new economy.
The Portuguese, French, and now Swedish Presidencies have raised expectations by pushing ahead with dossiers that had been hitherto neglected.
The Commission' s programme for 2001, however, gives no hint of these dossiers being brought to a successful conclusion.
Mr President, there is no justification for large companies making part of their workforce redundant on the pretext of mergers or restructuring, when just a small fraction of their profits would be enough to safeguard the jobs that have been lost.
Danone, Michelin, Aventis, Bull, Alstom, Moulinex and similar companies have shown a total disregard for the workers that they have made redundant and for the regions that may be condemned to a slow decline by the closure of a factory, and this shows the harm that these companies inflict on society.
We oppose the political opinions, in this House or elsewhere, that justify these criminal activities.
Such opinions show that they do not in any way seek to act in the interests of society; only in the interests of the industrial and financial groups that dominate the economy and in the interests of the owners and shareholders of these groups.
We also oppose those who pretend to deplore the effects of restructurings on society yet who do nothing to propose the slightest binding measure to prevent them.
Apart from a complete ban on job losses upon large companies which are making a profit, all other action is mere posturing.
We assure those who work for these companies, and who are fighting off these attacks upon them, that they have our solidarity.
They have chosen the only sensible route in this economy dominated by the law of the jungle.
Mr President, in her speech before the House this morning, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel expressed her amazement and alarm at the frequency with which this issue comes up in this House, and wondered why this is.
I too am amazed at how often it crops up.
We are concerned at the tragic implications of industrial restructuring and mergers - of which the workers are all too often only informed at the last minute when all the decisions have been made - for unemployment, working conditions, the very competitiveness of Community businesses and economic cohesion, and we appeal to companies' sense of responsibility and express our sympathy, but then we do not follow the cases up.
Community legislation does not go far enough and, what is more, in many cases it is disregarded or applied too leniently.
I could produce a long list, as many Members have done, of relevant cases which we have discussed in recent years.
One of the objectives set by the Lisbon Council was to achieve a high level of high quality employment.
How can we achieve a Europe which is both competitive and has a high level of high quality employment?
Of course, this can be accomplished by improving coordination and the play of balance between the Union's different policies, but there is no doubt that the Community legislation on the subject needs to be more effective and more stringent.
Therefore, we can wait no longer - and here the Commission must assume its responsibilities - for a revision of the directive on European works councils, mass redundancies and relocation of enterprises, which does not make specific provision for a system of effective penalties for failure to comply.
But what really appals me - and here I refer to the Council in particular - is that it is already two years since Parliament expressed its opinion at the first reading of the only instrument which would allow us to deal effectively with these issues, the information and consultation directive, and in these two years, despite the general agreement that dialogue is the best way to deal with problems, the Council has not yet been able to summon up the courage or the strength to adopt a position on the matter.
Parliament can no longer tolerate such behaviour.
Mr President, as the honourable Members have said, some of the directives were obviously adopted in times of full employment and very slow change.
Certain parts of the legislative framework therefore need amending and changing.
But I think that we should acknowledge the attempt being made in Europe to strike a balance between competitiveness and social cohesion.
Restructuring, mergers and takeovers do indeed often have dramatic consequences.
We recently saw over 5 000 jobs lost in a single month as the result of takeovers.
But if we look at the competitive environment as a whole, if we look at the environment in which European companies operate, then we will realise that there would be very adverse consequences if there were no reorganisation or restructuring, if European companies did not take an active part in the business economy.
And we need to calculate how many jobs are saved every time, because unless they restructure, some sectors risk disappearing altogether in the future.
In this extremely difficult environment, there are four strands to our efforts to combine social cohesion and competitiveness.
The first is forecasting.
This morning we examined how, through the Dublin Institute, we are trying to study, forecast and prepare changes.
The second is the legislative and institutional framework.
As you know, huge changes were made this year to legislation on the European company statute and to the five directives which follow and complete the legislative framework on the European statute, and the directive on information and consultation finally went to the Council after years of discussion between Parliament and the Commission and we achieved a majority within four months.
We reckon that, with the undertakings made by the Swedish Presidency and following the Belgian Presidency, significant changes will be made to the legislative framework.
I should point out here that legislation alone is not enough and that serious efforts have been made to extend controls. We are also endeavouring, in cooperation with Commissioner Monti, to check that the directives on information for workers are being properly applied during all mergers and takeovers.
In addition, a committee was recently set up within this legislative framework, one of the basic subjects of which is social dialogue and the role of social dialogue in helping to ensure that mergers and restructuring proceed smoothly.
The third strand is specific policy.
The strategy on employment and the availability of money from the Social Fund mean that problems of mass redundancies can be dealt with at national level, by retraining workers, through special structures to support their reintegration into the job market or by helping them start up their own companies.
Finally, the fourth strand is the role of companies, the social responsibility of companies.
This is one of the new basic items on the social agenda; we expect workers to change, to agree to a new, flexible environment, to train, to be prepared to move from one sector to another or one place to another.
But we cannot just ask workers to change their behaviour, which is why companies too have a new role in this area.
We are trying very specifically to define - and the second stage will be to look at this from an institutional point of view - to define the social responsibility of companies, their responsibilities in the wake of restructuring and their responsibilities in the local area, in the society in which they operate, which is why, as we said this morning, a Commission communication will be presented at the end of June.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Copyright and related rights in the Information Society
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0043/2001) by Mr Boselli, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with regard to the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the Information Society [9512/1/2000 - C5-0520/2000 - 1997/0359(COD)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive regulates the protection of copyright and related rights in the information society.
It is an important directive and its path has by no means been easy.
We have reached the second reading and Parliament is now called upon to express its opinion on the position adopted by the Council which, as you will remember, was forwarded to us 18 months after it had been adopted at first reading.
The reason for this is that a controversial, delicate compromise had to be found between all the interests covered by the directive.
I see this difficult, delicate compromise as a step forward for, apart from anything else, it includes many of the points proposed by Parliament at first reading.
There was room for improvement in some parts of the directive and this is what I have attempted to do.
Although some compromise amendments were adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, opinion is still divided, particularly with regard to the article on copying for technical purposes, or caching, and the article on private copying.
There are many amendments regarding this point which I do not endorse.
The reason why, as far as private copying is concerned, the compromise amendments adopted in committee represented a major new development benefiting the authors lies in the fact that they stipulate that private copying - and I quote - must be "made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly or indirectly commercial, on condition that the rightholders receive fair compensation".
This amendment introduces a new principle into Community legislation, in that it limits the scope of the definition of private copying, to the benefit of the authors, while clearly, at the same time, safeguarding the legitimate interests of the consumer.
This amendment, adopted by the committee, halts the huge increase in exchanges of unauthorised copies between users of sites such as Napster, and it will mean that it is no longer possible to describe the exchange of unauthorised works between Napster users as private copying.
I see this as an improvement on the text of the common position.
With regard to the other element, technical copying, I feel that the balance achieved in the common position is more than sufficient to protect both rightholders and consumers.
Although the intention behind the amendments tabled on this issue - Article 5, point 1 - to provide greater copyright protection is commendable, none of the amendments are acceptable, apart from anything else because they relate to application, not regulation which is the subject of this directive.
Furthermore, these amendments are intended to introduce a system of dual authorisation of works on the Internet, one for hosting and one for caching, which would be a heavy burden for the network management.
Therefore, to sum up, the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market showed that it is possible to reach a broad consensus, to adopt the directive and to improve the common position without running the risk of a long, tedious conciliation procedure; all this after three years of debate, argument and dispute.
In my opinion, this is an opportunity which the European Parliament must take: if, tomorrow, it supports the agreement reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and adopts the amendments which are the result of a broad compromise between a large number of political groups, then we will, at last, be able to adopt the directive.
This will benefit not only the European Union, which has been waiting for legislation on the subject for a long time, but also and most importantly, the rightholders.
Indeed, if the directive is adopted, not only will the exceptions which are still disputed enter into force, but also, most importantly, the rule established by Article 2 which lays down the principle of authorisation of rightholders for the use of works in new digital environments.
For all these reasons, it should I hope, be possible, at last, to adopt the text of this directive tomorrow.
Mr President, before beginning my speech, I must confess that I have a double interest in this issue.
On the one hand, I am an owner of intellectual property, being the author of several books and publications, and, on the other, I am a member of the Internet Foundation, which has various supporters in this Parliament.
Today coincides with an important event from the point of view of intellectual property in the information society, that is the judgment of the San Francisco Appeal Court in the Napster case, which brings us closer to finally resolving the vexed question of the use of the Internet to breach intellectual property rights.
The judgment of the San Francisco Court of Appeal confirms intellectual property rights and establishes certain measures for the protection of intellectual property in the United States.
The challenge facing us is to ensure that Europe also establishes a system which would safeguard intellectual property, otherwise we could find that, by means of installations in Europe, the effective protection measures which are currently being adopted in the United States under the Millennium Law, which has been in force for more than two years, could be violated.
We are lagging behind the United States, and, in this respect, I am in agreement with the rapporteur in the sense that we should bring this directive into play as soon as possible.
Now, in doing so, the Socialist Group is concerned that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.
We have tabled two amendments which we consider to be very important.
Firstly, the amendment relating to what is known as private copying.
Private copying, which was a traditional right of any person obtaining an intellectual work or intellectual property, must now, in the information society, be subject to very strict requirements, because of the enormous ease of reproduction.
This amendment proposes that the private copy should be intended for the personal use of the person making it, because otherwise, given the ease of reproduction, we run the risk that many copies can be made for the private use of persons other than the person making the copy.
Secondly, another very important amendment is the one relating to the incidental and transitional nature of reproduction.
If, as a consequence of the processes established by the information society, it is necessary to make a copy of a transitional and incidental nature, this should be intended to be of a genuinely transitional nature.
It would be unacceptable to create large libraries of intellectual property so that, at any given moment, the person who has been using that property can access it at will.
We believe that the accumulation of requirements that they be of a transitional and incidental nature is essential to safeguarding intellectual property.
I hope that in tomorrow's vote the various political groups can come to an agreement in order to offer alternatives which will truly guarantee the protection of intellectual property in the information society, since in a few years time, all intellectual property will probably be of the type that travels around the great communications networks.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to heap praise on Mr Boselli for his handling of this topic.
It was a tough job and he had to walk on eggshells to do it, but I feel he has managed to strike a better balance with the aid of his compromise amendments.
I also think - and perhaps we should really look into this as a Parliament some time - that there has perhaps been more lobbying over this issue than I have ever experienced in my brief career as an MEP.
If you consider that over 300 lobbyists have an interest in this report, then that means half a lobbyist to every MEP, and perhaps a few question marks are in order here too.
It would be a good thing if the common position, together with Mr Boselli' s compromise amendments were to be adopted tomorrow.
The liberals disagree on quite a few points, but as I understand it, we are at least united behind it, and I think that is indeed a positive sign.
In addition, there are a number of issues that Mr Boselli and Mr Medina have already mentioned today.
I have yet to see whether the compromise amendment on private copies goes far enough because I still have not read to the end - and as a lawyer, I dealt with intellectual property in my practice over a long period of time. I have yet to discover whether it is now no longer possible for a student to make copies for all his or her fellow students which they are allowed to use in private.
I have my doubts about this because I think it will allow illegal copying to continue with a vengeance.
So I am in favour of restricting private usage.
I also have my doubts about the technical measures that Member States are at liberty to introduce.
I fear that this will have a distorting effect on the internal market and will lead, in the final analysis, to the Court of Justice having to settle the matter again on the basis of the internal market principles.
Caching, now that is something I still have some difficulty with, the way things are going at the moment.
I believe this only has to do with the e-commerce directive, so I hope the Commissioner will take another look at the issue.
I would like to close with a comment, and I hope - on behalf of the Liberal Group at any rate - that an even-handed and fair balance will be found in this directive for all market participants and all parties concerned, and I feel that the digital copy should be regarded as an opportunity and not a threat.
Mr President, my thanks to all the honourable Members for their constructive cooperation and, above all, to the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Boselli.
Numerous problems, numerous conflicts of interest have still not been resolved.
Harmonising cultural traditions is no easy task.
A compromise does not really satisfy anyone and the European Parliament does not hold a magic wand.
There is talk of a balanced common position.
A balance between whom? Between rightholders and the public interest.
First and foremost - and this is my opinion and the opinion of the Greens - the rightholder's status under copyright law must be strengthened.
Copyright law must serve the rightholder.
His position must be strengthened for future contract negotiations.
As a politician for culture, my responsibility is, firstly, to give rightholders a secure basis for their existence and, secondly - and I do not mean secondarily but equally - to guarantee the public free access and, at the same time, ensure that high-quality works are available to the public in all their diversity.
We are opposed to extending the list of exceptions; some of the contentious points can perhaps be resolved between the parties, because we too are keen to find a satisfactory solution which we can all live with.
The Greens, you may have noticed, confined themselves to proposed amendments which relate solely to the rightholder - I refer to Amendments Nos 34 and 36. Perhaps, you will say, they anticipated future contracts.
Allow me now to reply: much is anticipated in the recitals which is of benefit not to the rightholder author but to other interested parties.
And as the Napster case has already been raised, Europe should discuss whether or not it wants a miniature version, a European Napster, and then it should hold a round table discussion between providers, producers, rightholders and consumers.
But I would not want Napster to find its way to Europe, in through the back door simply because copyright law is weak and the wording woolly.
This too is a possibility which we should debate.
We shall also have to hold a discussion at some point in the future - soon, I hope - on performing rights societies and on the possibility of contracts for copyright contract law.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after considering this issue of the directive on copyright and harmonisation which primarily involves a list of exceptions, I feel that we have quite simply agreed to maintain a confused situation in order to give ourselves time to give some thought to this matter.
This confusion is due to the fact this directive represents three different interest; i.e. authors and creative artists, consumers, who are also users, and producers and market makers.
Producers and market makers are trying to fit in between the other two and I feel that the directive is also in this uneasy position with its list of exceptions, to which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has just added another, extremely problematic, exception regarding broadcasting.
I believe that we are favouring the opinion of consumers.
However, what are we trying to make them buy?
I put to you the question: just what shall we buy in the near future, if we fail to protect and defend creativity?
That is the question we should ask ourselves.
As it happens, outside my parliamentary career, I have written books and I use public libraries and research centres.
In both cases, we need to have some protection, some security rather than insecurity, in order to be able to produce works.
If I look at this from the consumer' s point of view, I am surprised that Parliament, the defender of Market Europe, defends production in this market in such an ultimately very poor fashion, because, given this list of exceptions, people will refuse to pay for goods which they will want for nothing.
You must admit that it is surprising.
The conditions in which these goods are produced are not being questioned either; yet, to produce goods, we need creative artists and authors.
I have no idea what you will sell or buy when you no longer have any creative artists or authors but, in any case, Market Europe will not fare very well.
That is what will happen to the markets.
Now, if we take a close look at the details of the directive, it becomes apparent that if we say, for example, that archives come into being immediately, or after an hour, this means that everything broadcast on television is archive material.
Anyone with an interest in history is slightly surprised to hear archives being defined in this way.
If archives are just that and if private copying is widespread, what can we do to ensure that culture, and indeed cultural diversity, is not just heritage, museums, not just a list that we will find in places that are the stuff of archives and museums, but that it is a living creative field?
To do that, we must - like it or not - assist artistic creation.
To assist artistic creation, we must support copyright rather than criticise and attack it.
That is what my group will try to defend by its vote tomorrow.
Mr President, the report that has been presented on copyright and the information society, or rather the alleged information society, is a perfect example of the increasing depravity of a Community system whose only motivation is, in fact, to create a market where all products, goods and services are included.
Although the harm caused by this system is obvious, because harmonisation provides less protection than that previously afforded by Member States, despite that fact - I shall not give an example - the Commission and the Council are now proposing to transform all cultural services into saleable commodities, as Mrs Fraisse has just clearly said.
Using as an excuse the concept of the information society, which the financial markets are in the process of levelling out - we have come a long way in the last three years - this directive and the common position, which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market suggests we adopt, seek to make all European creativity, i.e. all creative artists, subject to the international trade regulations of the World Trade Organisation, though it is here dubbed the World Intellectual Property Organisation.
It is utterly ironic that the European Union institutions are basically in the process of becoming a subservient lapdog to globalisation without restriction or conscience.
That is why I believe that many of us here in this House will try to stop the acceleration of this process which completely strips the concept of Europe of all content and all meaning.
I hope that we shall reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market because they break with the tradition of a Parliament - as Mrs Fraisse quite rightly said - which has, until now, defended diversity in cultural production in Europe and the specific, and indeed exceptional role, of creative artists, writers and artists in European civilisation.
The information society is no more than a snare and we are indulgently allowing it to be used here in an attempt to confiscate the most timeless and most precious thing we can own - intellectual property.
Mr President, all copyright consists in a balancing of two sets of interests, on the one hand the authors' , producers' and production systems' interests and, on the other hand, the consumers' interests.
It might be said that consumers' interests are society' s interest in seeing the dissemination of both knowledge and cultural expression rather than the suppression of these and their subordination to the interests of capital.
Naturally, creators and authors must, and ought to, be assured of a fair economic return, but I have to say that, for me and the People' s Movement I represent, there are two crucial main points.
The first is to ensure the public' s or consumers' interest in being able to use both knowledge and culture.
In Denmark, the country I come from, we have a very well developed tradition of youth and adult education, and this must not be interfered with.
The second point is that the systems of enforcement and sanctions that have been developed and are practised in the different legal cultures in the different countries must not be interfered with either.
We have our own special system in Denmark, and I do not think it should be substantially interfered with.
I can say that I have seldom been exposed to such intensive lobbying as in connection with this proposal, and that is by no means strange.
There are billions of kroner and euros in the system in a sector dominated on the producer side by, above all, the American entertainment industry, but it is not of course this that we must mainly take an interest in.
I might also add that copyright is, of course, among the most complicated aspects of the legal world and that, within the copyright field, the law relating to digital products is practically incomprehensible.
I cannot imagine that more than a few per cent of MEPs at the most have any idea at all of what the problems really relate to.
Against this background, it is an interesting fact, and one worth noting, that the proposal has been so balanced that I shall recommend my group to vote in favour of it.
Mr President, as the first speaker from my group, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur on behalf of all my colleagues who work closely with him.
We welcome the robust way that he has defended the balance of this directive.
As the rapporteur said earlier, with the compromise amendments - the set of amendments passed by our committee - I am sure that we have the right directive at the right time.
No one pretends that it is perfect.
It is important to emphasise that.
There has been considerable difficulty in reconciling national traditions and exceptions.
There are countries that have levies, for example, on recording media.
We have sustained the objective of this directive because, above all, we want to encourage new creative artists to exploit this new technology.
This is an enabling, liberating directive.
It gives them the assurance that they will be able to create new works and to get fair rewards.
Equally, on the balancing side, consumers expect that their existing rights to be able make private copies, to be able to use library facilities, to be able, if they are disadvantaged, if they are blind or disabled, to have access to new forms of media will be safeguarded.
We have got that balance right.
The other point, colleagues, is that we are not arrogant enough in the Legal Affairs Committee to suggest to you that this is here for all time.
We have proposed and recommend very strongly to you that in 18 months' time this directive be reviewed.
We must, in a very fast-moving world, take responsibility for our work but be prepared to modify it in accordance with what is going on in an entirely new world.
That is a very important provision.
We have strengthened the review provisions.
We propose a very speedy turnaround, and that shows that the Legal Affairs Committee has taken a very responsible attitude to this directive.
We now want to get it transposed as soon as possible.
Why do we want to get it transposed as soon possible?
Because a crucial element in this quick transposition is that the European Union will be able to accede to the World Intellectual Property Organisation Treaty and that will bring a very important measure of global protection to all the artists involved.
That is really a prize worth having and worth having as quickly as possible.
Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor, despite the fact that I have not yet written a book and have not read a great many.
The protection of intellectual property has always been a cause for concern to the European Union and to the European Parliament, because we know that only this protection guarantees that we have culture, that culture flourishes and that economic production takes place.
This could have been an historic moment for the European Parliament.
But it is not.
For the first time in our lives, the protection of intellectual property is being undermined.
With the consent of the European Parliament.
As we have found out, the European Parliament still has only one objective: no conciliation.
After 18 months of deliberation in the Council, we have been told to get a move on.
After 18 months of deliberation in the Council.
And then the Council says "unanimously", although it could have voted by a qualified majority, given the balance we keep hearing about.
And then Parliament is asked not to make any more amendments. We might just as well shut up shop and go home.
I have never seen Members put under such pressure by their governments and parties.
But with the Council and the governments on either side, in the Council and in Parliament, what need is there for Parliament?
Parliament has its own responsibility and it must live up to it.
The common position has dramatically undermined authors' rights.
I am on the authors' side and I call on Parliament to restore these rights - at least to some degree.
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that many people must have been rather anxious when Mr Harbour said he wanted to see a review of the directive within 18 months.
So, is there to be a return to all that lobbying?
Is it not all a bit too soon?
Everything that can be said about the directive has already been said.
It is therefore a little difficult to begin to speak now.
I nonetheless want to express my warm thanks to our wonderful rapporteur.
I also want to say that the official line of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party at first reading was more balanced than that of the parliamentary majority.
We may therefore also consider that essential parts of the common position need to be changed.
At first reading, we were concerned that the parliamentary majority was jeopardising the Internet' s function and that there was a danger of creating a system which also made it unattractive to have material on the Net in Europe.
The results of the Human Genome Project have been published on the Net in the last few days, partly in the journal, Nature and partly in the journal, Science.
Via Nature, everyone can access the material but, via Science, it can only be accessed by paying SEK 3 million.
That is, of course, a protection of copyright.
But is it the same thing as promoting the spread of science and knowledge?
Where is the right balance to be found?
This is something I believe we should reflect upon when we adopt a position on the directive.
I also want to point out once again that our group' s official position now is to have as few amendments as possible.
The common position is a fragile compromise which must not be disturbed. Otherwise, we might not get the WIPO Treaty signed, which is of course the most important thing.
Mr President, it is a great privilege to take part in this important debate.
I am a bit sad that the tone of the debate has been in part negative and guarded.
We need to remember that new communication media have in fact liberated interaction between people and ideas and between people and people.
Of course, that does give rise to some reasonable concerns about the protection of legitimate copyright interests in this age.
Meeting these concerns must not result in obstructing the ordinary person, the scholar or the scientist from accessing and using materials that are subject to copyright.
The balance between producer interest and consumer interest has been stressed in this debate and is the balance that we have to try and strike.
If we in the Union were to strike the wrong balance, it would seriously inhibit the democratic openness of discussion that the Internet and related media facilitate.
If, for example, unreasonable restraints are placed on libraries, students, scholars and scientists will be the sufferers.
The Inter-Library Loan scheme might become an accidental casualty of change.
The draft directive before us refers critically in Article 5.5 to the well-established restraints on fair practice that are enshrined in the Berne Convention.
Subject to this, Member States will be able to create regulated limits on copyright interests for the benefit of disabled people, private consumers, public libraries and museums and some others.
That is permissive - Member States will not, in any case, be required to do it.
It will be a matter for local judgment guided by subsidiarity.
As an author myself, I yield to no one in maintaining the rights of authors and performers - I add "performers" deliberately - to fair recognition and reward, but these values will be misapplied if they are used as a ground for obstructing reasonable limitations on commercial copyright interests and, I stress "the commercial interests", which we need to differentiate from the moral right of the author, which is expressly excluded from this directive.
Like others, I am delighted with Mr Boselli's work and I hope that we will pass this with relatively few changes.
Mr President, serious infringements of and a lack of protection for intellectual property have long been a way of life in Greece, well before the advent of the information society.
With the new technologies available, artists are now looking more than ever to the European Union to deal with this issue at Community level.
Clearly, there are numerous contradictory points, multiple pressures and disputed theories and we ourselves - over and above the lobby - have seen another side of authors, another side of consumers of these works and, in this sense, I think that the work undertaken by Mr Boselli and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is the work of a magician.
I think they have seriously improved on the Council's common position, which did too little to protect intellectual property.
It is important that we limit the exceptions and I think that the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market is a careful amendment, although it might have gone further.
We also have to take care with libraries and archives because, if we make various amendments here, we will end up infringing intellectual property rights.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on having the wisdom of Solomon, the patience of Job and the tenacity of myself.
In particular, this issue, which is difficult and has been a very arduous task for all of us in the Legal Affairs Committee, has thrown up a number of conflicts, one of which most often mentioned within this House is the conflict between copyright-holders and consumers.
Many people feel that these two differing groups cannot be reconciled.
I believe that within the present text we have the opportunity to reconcile these two parties, and to lay down a number of fundamental principles which could be copied in other parts of the world.
These principles comprise, firstly, remuneration for those who are entitled to remuneration for creative works and for new ideas; secondly, the right of access to those works; thirdly, the rights of libraries and other institutions, educational institutions in particular, to make use of these works for research purposes; and fourthly the introduction of a number of exceptions to the copyright legislation to ensure that people with disabilities will not be unfairly discriminated against and to ensure that educational institutions can continue.
This is no easy task.
Each of us has a right, and indeed a responsibility, to ensure that we can maintain the best possible balance for all within the fundamental principles of consumer rights and protection as well as remuneration for the artists.
Mr President, I would, of course, also like to commend Mr Boselli' s determination to achieve a balance in a text that has been under discussion for nearly three years.
His task was made all the more difficult by the Council' s failure to adopt all Parliament' s amendments at the first reading stage.
As has been mentioned, the aim of the new directive is to adapt current legislation to the new technologies while respecting the international treaties adopted in 1996.
There is a legal void with regard to copyright protection in the digital age.
The Internet is a powerful tool but it must not be an unregulated area.
The cultural and economic stakes are high and, with the Internet expanding at an incredible pace, a legal framework in Europe must be found, as in the United States, where this kind of framework was adopted two years ago.
It is, therefore, an urgent matter, all the more so because this directive is a key factor in the fight against illegal copying, a matter particularly close to my heart, and because pirate copying is the scourge of the information society. It becomes all the more crucial in a digital age because the first copies and any subsequent copies retain a quality close to that of the original.
Consumers are acknowledged as being entitled to make private copies.
It is only natural that the eligible parties are fairly compensated in return, it is only fair.
In order to ensure that we are talking about purely private copies, the law must be written in sufficiently restrictive terms and the wording of the definition must be perfectly unambiguous.
So I am in favour of a restrictive definition of private copying.
In order to protect works of art against illegal copying, eligible parties must be given the opportunity to use technical protection.
That is why hackers, as they are called, must be fought by clamping down on the means they offer to the public to overcome protection systems, thereby encouraging the illegal copying of protected works of art.
This new context is constantly changing and raises many questions and concerns.
The directive must balance the interests of consumers and eligible parties.
It is trying to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but in a necessarily imperfect way.
If we amend this directive, we shall, in two years' time, be able to determine its shortcomings and weaknesses in the light of the incredible developments in the information society.
Mr President, as we say in my country, 'until the baskets are washed, it is still harvest time' . In other words, hope remains for authors and performers that this Parliament will have a change of heart, if not today then tomorrow.
I say this because I believe that a balance can be reached between the democratisation of knowledge that the new technologies and the Internet offer us with one click of the mouse and the continuity of the creative act, which will die out as a result of non-payment and lack of fair compensation for its value.
The virtual contradictions that mask financial interests and demagogic opposition are therefore unacceptable in this real social debate.
Let us not be naive, Mr President.
Creation and performance are economic factors and always have been. Hence the need for copyright and performers' rights.
Unfortunately, the Commission proposal and the Council common position reveal a degree of thoughtlessness that warrants our criticism.
In the name of consumer freedom, the consumption of art is pitted against artistic creation, in the same way that the Council accepts creative freedom as an obstacle to knowledge and to Europe' s citizens becoming enriched by culture.
New media technologies are not the enemies of intellectuals and authors, but we cannot pretend that, in this cyber world we live in, protecting the weakest member, i.e. authors, means defending a monopoly.
Let us not, in the name of consumers' rights, sacrifice authors' rights, and, above all, let us not accept the idea that artistic creation should be suspicious of technology, which is the cardinal sin of the text we are discussing.
Mr President, despite the considerable efforts that have been made and despite a certain amount of progress, which is due to the attitude of our rapporteur, whom I warmly congratulate, we still do not have a text that brings together the three fundamental freedoms of the cultural act: the freedom to create, the freedom to communicate and the freedom to consume.
Unless we achieve this quickly, some of Europe' s fundamental values will disappear for good.
Furthermore, our languages will be of little use if, at the altar of technology, they become merely the remnant of the identity that gives any European uniqueness in the eyes of the world.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the honourable Members from the various groups for supplying the 32 signatures which allowed me to submit a number of amendments in Parliament.
I am absolutely convinced that we must endeavour, on a couple of points, to revert back to Parliament' s opinion from the first reading, which we adopted exactly two years ago by a very large majority.
It is mainly to do with tightening up on private copying, establishing clear regulations for the on-line storage of data so that the responsibility of Internet providers is better defined in line with the e-commerce directive, and the possibility of Member States being able to introduce technological protection measures without disrupting the internal market.
Why am I defending this opinion?
First and foremost for reasons of principle.
Is there anything more important than protecting private property?
Is there anything more personal than the product of human talent, the creation of something which rejuvenates.
The European Parliament has always been the guardian of Europe' s cultural heritage and that is how it must stay, also in the digital age.
If we do not put a brake on indiscriminate copying, there will soon be nothing left to copy.
After all, if we fail to provide protection, people will lose the incentive to be creative and produce new works of art.
But there is more to this debate than principles.
Copying will also cost jobs.
According to current estimates, one hundred thousand jobs have been lost in the European Union owing to the copying of CDs.
The State loses out on income too.
Apparently, the State of Belgium alone, which I know very well, misses out on one billion Belgian Francs in VAT as a result of this practice, and the same goes for all government coffers.
We must be in no doubt about what it is we are risking.
I would like to echo Mr Rothley' s sentiments.
So all in all, I think there is good reason to support the amendments which I tabled, together with many of my fellow delegates, for which I would like to thank you in advance.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is of great importance to growth and competitiveness in Europe, but the directive does not need to be worded in such a way as to make using the Internet more difficult and more expensive.
If we impose higher costs on e-commerce and increase the cost of connection, Europe will not be the world' s most competitive economy in ten years' time, which was, of course, the goal set in Lisbon.
If we in Parliament are to increase people' s confidence in us as European legislators, European legislation must be coherent. The e-commerce directive and this directive must be in line with each other.
We must not therefore alter Article 5.1 or recital 33. Copyright must not become a patent right because of the new technology.
Our good will towards copyright holders must not involve our creating regulations which restrict freedom of expression or obstruct the free flow of information.
The ceiling above which an outsider' s server may be closed down must be set very high.
If every bit of data that passes through the server every second is to be monitored, we forfeit what basically has made the Internet successful and has increased productivity in countries with high Internet use, namely the fact that everyone gets to be involved and to share knowledge.
I would therefore ask you to support Amendment No 4.
Our copyright legislation must be created around the work and around the artist entitled to remuneration, and not around the technical form.
TV channels must decide for themselves how they make their programmes and the music they want to play available.
A right to copy on-air broadcasts for storage on electronic systems is required because, otherwise, the giant recording companies will be able to control the radio and television companies' music output.
I would therefore ask you to support Amendments Nos 31 and 32.
Copyright is not absolute. Exceptions are required.
I therefore hope that the Chamber will safeguard the exceptions for libraries and for people with disabilities so that we do not undermine democracy by shutting people off from information.
Finally, we have a WIPO position to defend, and we must vote consistently.
I am hoping for a positive decision, for then we shall be accepting international responsibility.
Mr President, even as we try at second reading to tweak the common position on copyright here and there, we should not lose sight of the fact that, whatever the outcome of tomorrow's vote or of the impending conciliation procedure, we have achieved both very little and a great deal.
Very little because the level of harmonisation of copyright in the European Union will not be very high, much lower in fact than in many other less important areas.
National traditions are simply too varied here and the interests of all those involved are too diverse and too contradictory.
But, compared with the current situation, we will have achieved a great deal if the directive as contained in the common position or, even better, with the amendments adopted tomorrow, can be improved and can enter into force quickly.
At least we now have a standard definition for a few core concepts.
The full development of the information society will no longer be impeded by a grossly insecure legal framework and rightholders and their agents will have ways of protecting their interests.
Technical means of protection in particular are developing at a very fast pace.
At the same time, however, we must guarantee wide public access in the interest of cultural diversity.
This obviously includes not criminalising consumers or charging them several times over.
It also includes developing cultural heritage, such as the cultural heritage stored in television archives, and ensuring that libraries are able to fulfil their valuable role in the online world.
Like some of my fellow Members, I feel that the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has compromised the hard-struck balance in favour of the exceptions and I therefore hope that at least some of the proposed amendments tabled by my group will still be accepted.
Mr President, as an author and member of the Portuguese Society of Authors, I have a personal interest in a matter in which the cultural standing of European integration itself is also at stake.
It makes no sense for Europe to herald the fundamental value of its cultural and linguistic pluralism and, at the same time, render it devoid of meaning.
I do not know of a single author in Europe who agrees with the compromise amendments on private copying.
This means something.
I also wish to say that it would be much better if the directive were to give this satisfaction to authors now and were then to be reviewed within eighteen months.
Most of the exceptions to copyright that are provided for open the way for a cancerous type of process, which will give rise to the wild, uncontrolled proliferation of copyright abuses.
The more exceptions are provided for, the further the right to regulate is weakened and the more harm is done to the harmonisation and coordination of national organisations in this field.
It is extremely important that the range of exceptions should be limited.
It is not enough to remove the possibility of using copies for purposes that are directly or indirectly commercial.
Copies are very frequently used for atypical purposes such as exchanges, loans and gifts, and there are many other causes for the uncontrolled proliferation of further copies, which has serious consequences for authors and publishers.
Unless the concept of private use is made to mean only home use or copying with the author' s permission, instead of solving the key problems, the directive will continue to be an incentive to unbridled piracy.
To conclude, I shall quote from one of the messages that I have received from various Portuguese authors, one of whom is the Nobel prize winner, José Saramago, who writes: "as artists, we are particularly concerned that large-scale unauthorised copying will make it impossible for all those who make up the creative community to earn a living.
Those who have nothing to do with the creative process will consume the fruit of other people' s labours without making any productive reinvestment, unless private copying effectively retains its status as private copying" .
Mr President, we need to be clear about what we are trying to achieve in this directive.
This directive, as a piece of intellectual property legislation, must try to incorporate structures to reward the creative industries, which in my own Member State alone contribute GBP 60 billion to our national economy and GBP 8 billion of exports.
They also employ 1.4 million people.
At the same time we must not strangle or restrict freedom of access for legitimate users.
This fits in with the EU action plan and the forthcoming summit in Stockholm.
The fact is that the Internet genie is out of the bottle.
We cannot stop technology, but neither can we allow it to render copyright dead or to let it be abused as a safe haven for piracy, parasites and mass illegal copying.
Yesterday's Napster ruling clearly showed that copyright has to be applied to cyberspace.
We must not encourage people to infringe copyright.
The composition of the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur has maintained this balance between rightholders and users effectively.
The exceptions which currently exist in Article 5 mean that the generous provisions on exceptions that we have in the UK will continue to help vulnerable users and ensure that schools, libraries and research and education institutions can benefit from private copying.
In the UK we also record programmes so that we are able to watch at the time and place we choose and that, of course, needs to remain intact.
It is however regrettable that some unnecessary, unhelpful amendments have crept in at the last stage in committee.
I refer to: Amendment No 11, which seeks to give an exemption to broadcasting companies which no one else enjoys and which would reduce performers' and artists' rights in contravention of the WIPO Treaty; and Amendment No 4 which, in the second part, introduces an unnecessary and unwarranted EU restriction of the freedom of national courts to decide how to deal with injunctions, in particular concerning piracy, and amendments on levies.
While this is well-intentioned, we cannot support this approach because it could be interpreted, taken in a vague sense, to mean that levies should always be introduced when you have no technical protection in place.
The UK does not operate a system of levies and we do not want to see it introduced through the back door.
Finally, as with every other piece of legislation on the Internet that comes before us in this House, we should use the provisions of the directive, the review clause in Article 12 and the role of the contact committee to prevent both the abuse of private copying and any abuse or limitation on fair use.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to join the House in thanking the rapporteur.
It is amazing how calmly and composedly he has cut his way through this jungle of interests.
The lobby has already been mentioned.
It was indeed persistent but, on balance, it was, I think, a fair discussion and for that, too, I am grateful.
A great deal has been said about the need for balance.
I am afraid that the common position has not yet struck the balance needed.
Parts of the directive penalise the internal market, parts penalise consumers and parts penalise innovation.
The directive penalises the internal market because, at the end of the day, the harmonisation is only cosmetic and the Member States are defending their conventional payment systems tooth and claw, even though they are basically unsuited to the digital world.
We want to prevent that, which is why we suggest in proposed Amendment No 12 that the Member States should at least submit new compensation systems to the Commission and obtain a recommendation.
The directive also penalises consumers because it is quite possible that consumers will have to pay once when they buy a CD or a DVD and then again in the form of a levy.
Then when they come to make a copy, the data is copy-protected and the Member States have not even undertaken to look at copy protection systems and legal copying.
And the common position penalises innovation because it tries desperately to keep the global fee system alive in the digital age, despite the fact that new technology basically makes global fees superfluous, because copy protection allows the rightholder to be paid directly for copies and that is the fairest solution of all.
That is a directive for a citizens' Europe.
It offers the citizen security and fair freedoms in the digital world.
Mr President, I am delighted to see that both the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur accepted that it was unwise to reopen a large number of issues in this area and that much of what was achieved in the common position reflects a balance on this very complicated problem.
I hope that the House will also limit the number of amendments that are adopted and not interfere too greatly with the common position.
It is a directive which I and the British Conservatives welcome because it is vital that European citizens are given proper protection of their creative rights and creative works in the digital era and this directive will deliver that to them.
This is essential because, not only is there an enormous music industry and film industry, we must not forget the highly successful computer games industry which is generating a huge amount of revenue in the United Kingdom and in a number of other countries across the EU.
But the British Conservatives also firmly uphold the rights of those who take advantage of the public interest exceptions.
Groups such as the disabled, including blind people who need access to Braille copies in order to access the Internet, groups such as researchers, universities and libraries: these kinds of rightholder exceptions are vital for promoting research which is so important for our economic health.
A less high profile exception that is important economically is the right of reverse engineering of computer software.
We would entirely reject those amendments which are seeking to inhibit the use of those public interest exceptions.
We therefore accept the need to tighten up the wording of Article 6(4), to clarify its role and to restrict it to truly on-demand interactive services.
Having said that, there is another exception which is more controversial, which is ordinary private copying.
We are all pleased to see the rules have been tightened up to prevent it being abused and used as a loophole for piracy; that is something that we would also support.
I would lastly express some reservations about Amendment No 11.
If this amendment is passed, I fear that the broadcasters will have an advantage.
They are getting something for nothing.
I think this skews the common position a little and, unless someone can convince me otherwise, I would have grave reservations about Amendment No 11.
We have a sensible and balanced position and I fear Amendment No 11 may tilt that balance in the wrong direction.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common position, as amended by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, is an attempt to strike a fair balance between the interests of artists, authors and rightholders and the interests of consumers.
The common position therefore regulates when third parties can copy copyright protected works such as texts, graphics, music or films.
Member States are also required to protect copy protection under the law.
It is important, from the consumer's point of view, that private copies will be allowed in future.
There are - and this has been addressed several times today - differing views as to what constitutes a private copy.
In my view, the definition should include the family environment.
That means that the proposed wording accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has my full support.
Finally, it is also important from the consumer's point of view that new remuneration schemes, i.e. levies on equipment or media, can only be introduced if they help to achieve equal levies throughout Europe.
Unilateral national action, such as the so-called PC levy, which keeps cropping up in discussions in the Member States, would only make equipment even more expensive.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also tabled proposals here and I call on Parliament to support them tomorrow.
Finally, the directive also regulates when broadcasting organisations are entitled to use their archive productions for on-demand services and when they must first sign a contract with all the rightholders involved in the TV production giving them the right to do so.
The rights, the archives of broadcasting organisations are of immeasurable cultural and historical value.
We must therefore do everything we can to make these archives accessible, including for online use.
I therefore urge the House to support Article 11 and I agree here with my fellow Member, Mrs Villiers.
I think that there is every reason to offer a separate regulation for public radio.
I would firstly like to apologise for having arrived late for this debate: I was in another meeting and that is why I am speaking last, despite the fact that I have had the honour of taking responsibility for this issue on behalf of the European People's Party.
Mr President, my first words are words of thanks, and I can also add my thanks as Chair of the committee, for the work carried out by the rapporteur.
I say this sincerely.
I believe that it would be hard to find a more complex issue, on which pressure has been unleashed from all the interest groups, which have legitimately fought to have their positions adopted by the various political groups.
There are few issues on which we have received so many, if not tonnes then at least metres of faxes and e-mails as we have on this one.
The rapporteur has been masterly in his navigation of these turbulent waters; he has always remembered that a rapporteur is rapporteur for a committee, not for any group or any position: he is rapporteur for a committee and he is duty-bound to reflect the majority position of that committee.
I am pleased to say that the amendments put forward by the rapporteur were supported by a huge majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr President, please allow me now to make some comments which are going to reiterate what has already been said, because at this point in the debate everything has really been said already.
This is a much-criticised directive, and it is worthy of criticism; but this is a case, as is so often the case in European integration, in which what is best and what is feasible are not the same thing.
As has already been said, we are starting from a situation in which there is complete divergence between the laws of the various Member States, where in reality the concept of copyright, the whole gamut of obligations and rights which this concept is represented by in our different laws, is not even similar.
It is not simply that are not the same, but that they are not even similar.
To try to harmonise them is an heroic quest.
This directive is a first step, but Parliament accepted this gamble on first reading and therefore it has to be consistent and continue in this vein on second reading.
At first reading we could have adopted disruptive positions; that was not Parliament's approach, and we accepted a directive full of exceptions.
At the moment, the amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs, added to certain other notable amendments which deserve to be supported, improve this directive on certain substantial points, such as private copying.
I refer to what has already been said.
And in summary they improve the directive by making it a first step in a system of harmonisation which will have to be carried out over time, a first step which furthermore will enable us to fulfil our international commitments, since until this directive sees the light of day, the two WIPO Treaties will not be able to enter into force.
That is also an important responsibility at a time when we talk so much about globalisation.
Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this important subject.
I should like to begin by saying that the discussion on this subject has taken a long time, as Mr Boselli indicated a little while ago - I think he said three years.
That indicates the importance, as well as the controversial nature, of this proposal.
After long discussions, in which this Parliament played a very constructive role, we are meeting today to consider what I hope will be a balanced compromise.
We now need to agree as rapidly as possible on a set of rules on copyright and related rights in the information society at European level, in order to increase the competitiveness of the Community and to implement our obligations at international level.
This directive will be a cornerstone in the establishment of a harmonised legal framework on copyright, in a digital environment in particular.
As such, it belongs to those measures for which the Lisbon Summit at the end of last year set us a clear deadline.
The Community needs such a framework if it is not to lag behind its major trading partners and, as was remarked this afternoon, we are already lagging behind the United States.
Furthermore, without such a framework in place, rightholders and users cannot respond to the challenges posed by technology in the market place.
The adoption and implementation of this directive is also a precondition for the European Union to ratify rapidly the two WIPO treaties which were adopted in 1996.
Here we carry an important responsibility as the coming into force of the WIPO treaties depends largely on this directive and therefore on us.
The formal decision to ratify the treaties was adopted by the Council on 16 March 2000.
Parliament has already endorsed that decision, but without this directive neither we nor the Member States could move towards ratification of those treaties.
Throughout the legislative process, Parliament has played a significant role.
The important changes to this directive introduced after the first reading clearly reflect the influence of this Parliament.
We welcome the constructive approach of the rapporteur, Mr Boselli, and of the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio - whom it is a particular pleasure to see again today - and also the members of the committee which Mrs Palacio chairs.
They have shown a keen sense of appreciation of the issues at stake in this directive, reducing the number of amendments to 15.
Most of those amendments were, in fact, compromise amendments, also on crucial issues.
The Commission appreciates the efforts made by the rapporteur on private copying and by the Committee on Legal Affairs when it voted not to amend the technical copies exception.
The Commission is in a position to accept all of the compromise amendments.
We have, however, concerns about some of the other amendments which have been voted.
I shall now say something about each of those amendments, although very briefly.
Firstly, Amendment No 2.
It deals with remuneration schemes and the products to which they apply, even though such schemes are outside the scope of the directive.
This directive requires fair compensation for certain of the exceptions, one of which is private copying.
The system of fair compensation envisages flexibility for Member States, rightholders and users to establish the basis on which those exceptions apply.
Amendment No 4 does not respect the principle of proportionality because it seeks to lay down conditions for the granting of injunctions.
But the issue of sanctions is already adequately dealt with in the directive.
Amendment No 11, about which I shall be speaking in reply to some remarks made a little while ago, adds a further exception for broadcasters, framed in terms which were rejected by Parliament itself at first reading.
The exception proposed goes too far and risks putting the Community in breach of its international obligations under the WIPO treaties, for which this directive is meant to be the instrument of ratification.
Amendment No 12 as currently drafted risks undermining the Commission's own powers to take measures when Member States take action that affects the functioning of the internal market.
For this reason the Commission cannot see its way to accepting it.
Amendment No 13 adds nothing to the text of Article 6(4) which already provides for fair compensation for private copying.
In the light of the above, we support the compromise amendments by the rapporteur and the Legal Affairs Committee but not Amendments Nos 2, 4, 11, 12 and 13.
Moreover, a series of further amendments, namely Amendments Nos 16 to 45, have also been tabled in Parliament.
The majority of those amendments have been rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee.
Three amendments, however, namely Amendments Nos 26, 27 and 28, are new.
In all cases, however, the issues raised by those amendments have been thoroughly considered, not just in the course of this second reading, but throughout the history of this directive - considered by my services but also by Member States.
None of those further amendments are acceptable to the Commission.
I should now like to address some of the questions and comments made this afternoon more specifically.
First of all, there are the questions and remarks made by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Manders and Mr Echerer on private copying and on the use of the words "for private use".
The question is should or should not the Commission support Amendment No 5 and if so, why?
In reply to that question, I should like to say that the Commission is of the view that Amendment No 5 provides greater security for rightholders while at the same time allowing legitimate private copying in a manner which is enforceable both by Member States and by rightholders and it clarifies what is commercial by including ends that are both direct and indirect.
There are several safeguards built into this directive which qualify the extent to which private copying may take place and thereby act as a deterrent to piracy.
That is particularly the case in relation to the protection of technological measures.
The Commission is of the opinion that the reference to "private use" is too narrow a formulation and would give rise to difficulties in enforcement especially in the private domain.
Then there is the question and a comment made by Mr Manders on Article 5 and in particular on the words "transient" and "incidental".
On that point, Article 5(1) has been at the centre of attention in all institutions.
There have been many amendments tabled both in the Legal Affairs Committee and again here in Parliament which propose changing the text of the common position.
The Legal Affairs Committee very wisely rejected all those amendments when it voted on 6 February 2001 and the Commission accepted the text of the common position which states that the acts of copying, in order to be exempted, must be transient or incidental and that they should form an essential part of a technological process.
The Commission prefers "or" to "and" in this context because making the conditions cumulative by adding "and" may make the whole exception too narrow and less operational.
In addition, including "essential" seems to make sense, as it would be difficult to justify why the exception should privilege acts of reproduction which are not an "essential" part of a technological process.
The current text of Article 5(1) together with the interpretative guidance provided in recital 33 ensures - in the Commission's opinion - a satisfactory balance between the rights of rightholders and the legitimate interests of other parties involved such as telecom operators, users, consumers and other parties.
Together with Article 8 on remedies and sanctions, Article 5(1) will help to provide for effective copyright protection against piracy whilst at the same time promoting the smooth operation of networks.
In particular, it gives service and access providers the necessary legal certainty for their activities on the networks.
Responding to comments made by Mrs Fraisse, Mrs Villiers and a number of others on Amendment No 11, may I say the following.
There is already an exception for broadcasters based on an amendment adopted by this Parliament at first reading.
It introduced a new exception for broadcasters relating to so-called ephemeral reproductions.
To introduce a further exception would not only disturb the balance of rights achieved, but could also lead to a violation of Member States' international obligations.
In relation to Amendment No 11, a similar amendment was proposed at first reading.
The Commission could not accept that amendment as it disturbed the balance between the parties concerned and might have caused considerable damage to authors, performing artists or other holders of the rights concerned.
The Commission is in agreement with Mrs Fraisse, Mrs Villiers and almost all speakers in rejecting this amendment.
I wish to thank Mrs Palacio for her support throughout the history of this proposal.
If it had not been for her leadership and guidance in the Legal Affairs Committee, it would not have been possible to steer our way through both the first reading and now the second reading, and the Commission is duly grateful to her.
The Commission would also like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament in general for the excellent work performed.
The common position represents the views of an entire cross-section of diverging interests: the creative and artistic communities, the academic, educational and scientific communities and also consumer groups and bodies representing socially disadvantaged users.
Nonetheless, in spite of the complexity of the groups whose interests have to be taken into account, the directive ensures a sufficiently high degree of copyright harmonisation and it should be possible to reach a final agreement today.
We have gone very far in meeting the concerns of everyone so, as Mr Boselli put it earlier this afternoon, I hope that this proposal will be approved tomorrow and that it will be adopted with as little change as possible.
Deliberate release of GMOs into the environment
The next item is the report (A5-0032/2001) by Mr Bowe, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Directive 90/220/EEC [C5-0685/2000 - 1998/0072(COD)].
Mr President, we are now close to the end of what has been a three-year process of reforming the legislation for the control and genetically modified use of organisms as products within the European Union.
We have now completed the process of reconciliation and we have a text for final approval.
The text before us meets many of Parliament's demands at first and second reading.
We have the precautionary principle reaffirmed.
We have tighter risk assessment of all GMO releases.
We have schemes for monitoring traceability that will ensure continuous assessment of all releases throughout the ten-year life of this time-limitation for consents. We have achieved the phasing out of all harmful, antibiotic-resistant marker genes.
We have a clear timetable.
We have a clear and transparent process and a clear timetable for the approvals which ensure the mandatory consultation of the public which guarantees public registers of locations of GMOs grown and used.
Steps have also been taken on the issues of liability, traceability and labelling.
Parliament can only be satisfied on those issues, however, when we see the additional legislation and flanking measures which I understand are now in preparation within the Commission.
In short, we have in front of us today for our approval the toughest GMO legislation in the world, so tough, in fact, that some natural foods in common use today would not pass through this procedure.
Should we approve this legislation tomorrow it would mean the beginning of the end of the present informal 'moratorium' on GMO commercial approvals.
Certain Members of the Council have, however, already made it clear that they will scrutinise individual applications for approval and may not allow commercialisation until legislation on traceability and labelling is in place. I welcome this.
This is a final safeguard to the recommencement of an approval process which has been long awaited but it can be no reason for opposing the final approval of the new 90/220 legislation we have in front of us now.
This legislation is an essential building block and foundation for the success of those measures still to come.
I therefore commend this important legislation to the House.
It is essential to ensure the safe and proper use of GMO products within the European Union.
It is essential to ensure the building of public confidence in these products, it is essential to ensure that this new technology, which promises so much, will in the end deliver what we are seeking from it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we often begin our speeches in the European Parliament by thanking the rapporteur.
I wish to do so again today, and it is meant as more than just lip service.
Mr Bowe has done a magnificent job and brought a very complicated procedure to a close.
I should also like to thank you, Commissioner Wallström and the Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Ingo Friedrich.
Both put a great deal of effort into finding an agreement; unfortunately, the same cannot be said of everyone else involved in the conciliation procedure.
We have brokered a good compromise.
The new regulation gives Europe a high standard of health, consumer and environmental protection.
The disputed antibiotic-resistant marker genes will be banned in Europe in the future.
Potential environmental dangers must be closely monitored.
Labelling of GMOs has been improved, although we expect further action by the Commission on this.
We have not passed a regulation preventing the application of green biotechnology and the PPE-DE Group welcomes that.
The PPE-DE Group is in favour of green biotechnology, provided that care is taken to ensure that rules to protect the environment and human health are respected.
Yesterday scientists and researchers from all over the world announced that they had completely decoded the human genome.
The euphoria which this announcement triggered throughout the world contrasts strangely with the emphatic rejection triggered by the release of genetically-modified plants, especially in Europe.
I think that neither euphoria at the human genome project nor total rejection of genetically-modified plants is called for.
In both areas there are huge opportunities, but there also risks which must be contained by suitable legislation.
The application of genetics to medicine is by no means risk-free; there have already been deaths during research into gene therapy in the USA because the rules were not applied properly.
The so-called reproductive cloning of human beings is no longer a chimera and is being seriously pursued by a number of scientists, as we have again seen over the last few days.
The artificial distinction between clones of human embryos for stem cell research and so-called reproductive clones will become blurred in the long term and I believe that the first cloned baby will probably be born before the promised relief for patients with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.
Just as red genetic engineering is by no means all opportunity, green genetic engineering is by no means all risk.
There is a realistic chance that genetically-modified plants will allow us to make huge progress with renewable primary products.
Specifically modified plants will perhaps soon allow cheaper and safer drugs to be manufactured.
We should therefore make use of the opportunities in both areas and limit the dangers with suitable legislation.
Developments in the release of genetically-modified plants from research into the human genome - for which we have practically no rules in Europe - will result, once the preliminary report is accepted, in a suitable set of rules for all the Member States in the European Union, which is why we should adopt this motion.
The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the Bowe report.
Mr President, after three long years, we are, at last, nearing the end of the process of revising Directive 90/220/EEC.
Anyone who has watched the progress made, step by step, towards this goal, as I have, cannot fail to agree that we are providing the European Union with legislation on genetically modified organisms which, in addition to improving upon the previous legislation, also places us at the forefront on an international level.
Just one example is the procedures for granting authorisations, particularly in terms of transparency and accessibility to the public, which is an essential condition for the necessary research trials to be able to proceed in a favourable climate. Further examples are the assessment and monitoring of the cumulative effects on the environment, and the phasing out of antibiotic-resistant marker genes.
The lion's share of the praise for this progress must certainly go to our rapporteur, Mr David Bowe, who has succeeded in combining decisiveness with flexibility.
It is certainly the fault of the Commission, rather than Mr Bowe, if we are still labouring under the burden of being unable, at present, to adopt flanking legislation on the tracing and labelling of GMOs and GMO derivatives placed on the market and thereby present the consumer with a complete framework of certainties.
The undertaking, confirmed yesterday in a letter from the Commission to the Members of the parliamentary delegation, is important in political terms but does not entirely make up for the delays in preparing a clear, well-defined proposal.
For these reasons, I am convinced that we should endorse the conclusions of the conciliation procedure, but with one explicit reservation: the moratorium on commercial approvals must remain in place until the gap has been filled.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the new directive is a huge improvement over the old one, on that we are all agreed.
The public register was a fundamental and central cause for concern to us Greens.
Monitoring is included, as is the testing of long-term effects.
We expressly welcome all this.
However, we shall abstain - and with good cause - because the main points of the directive have not been clarified.
There is unholy confusion in the area of genetic engineering at European level and no steps have been taken to label derivatives and GMOs and guarantee their traceability.
We have not clarified the question of exports of GMOs to non Member States.
I think that we have a moral responsibility to apply the same standards to third countries here as we do to ourselves and, more importantly, we have not clarified liability as a central factor.
The EU Commission is to make proposals here, it is true, but we do not know what they are.
I rather feel that we are buying a pig in a poke.
The BSE crisis should be a lesson and a reminder to us.
It is just not on, expecting the taxpayer to stump up for the damage and passing the risks onto society, while the genetic engineering companies only get the profits.
Which is why I do not expect any more GMO consents to be granted until legislation has been passed on liability.
So far, all we have is a declaration of intent; we do not have corporate liability and it is just not on, insisting that anyone who wants to register a car must produce an insurance certificate, while someone producing dangerous organisms, some of the long-term consequences, risks and dangers of which are still unknown factors, need not.
There is therefore no reason for Member States such as Germany and France to lift their de facto moratoria.
I think we have a huge crisis of confidence in consumer protection and unless derivatives are labelled, in other words, unless there is transparency and liability and responsibility can be taken ...
(The president cut the speaker off)
Mr President, we in the Group of the European United Left wish to retain the moratorium on releasing genetically modified crops for commercial cultivation.
This position is not changed by the clear improvements due to Directive 90/220 and which we are now discussing.
In the conciliation, it was, in particular, we in the Group of the European United Left, together with the Greens, who fought for the improvements which have now in fact been made, for example the gradual elimination of antibiotic-resistant markers, greater transparency and better risk assessments.
We have also achieved at least a half victory when it comes to public registers of GMOs, but it is still very unclear whether the Member States really see themselves as being obliged to report publicly on all GMOs cultivated for commercial purposes.
Clarification from the Council of Ministers and the Commission is needed on this matter.
It is not advisable to adopt laws on matters about which, right from the beginning, there are different interpretations.
We have still not seen the new rules promised to us by the Commission and required for labelling, traceability and accountability.
Until we know what they look like and until they have been fully implemented, we cannot contemplate lifting the moratorium.
Nor do we believe that, when the moratorium is lifted, it should be possible for any Member State to be forced to cultivate genetically modified crops.
We consider the strategy devised by the Commission whereby new crops are to be approved before these rules are fully in place to be objectionable and contrary to the precautionary principle.
It is also significant that there is a desire here to pre-empt the reading in Parliament and in the Council of Ministers.
There is now no demand for genetically modified food in the European Union.
More and more parts of the world are abandoning GM crops.
There are major differences of opinion between researchers about the risks involved in GM crops.
This applies both to the risk of contaminating other species and to possible effects on human health.
To insist, in this situation, upon the cultivation of more GM crops for commercial purposes would be foolhardy and lead to a very great deal of opposition.
Recent scandals and problems involving food policy ought to have taught us to proceed carefully.
The interests of consumers and the precautionary principle must be allowed to take precedence over the commercial interests of a few large companies.
We want to retain the moratorium on commercial cultivation.
There is a risk that the revision of this directive may be taken by the Commission as a pretext for approving new GM crops for cultivation.
That is not something to which we can be a party.
In spite of the fact that, in the conciliation, our group has had an important role to play in making these rules as tough as possible, we cannot vote in favour of the final result.
Mr President, I compliment Mr Bowe on his work in this area.
Commissioner Byrne's White Paper on food safety sets the ground rules and parameters within which the practical application of genetic research impacts on public health and the environment, and I have no doubt the vigilance of Parliament is a further safeguard.
While I have always favoured the application of safe and tested genetic research to agriculture, equally its practical application in future must be tempered by inevitable changes to agricultural practices resulting from the unrelated but nonetheless devastating consequences for farmers and consumers resulting from BSE.
The vigilance we are rightly demonstrating on the release of genetically modified organisms on the environment and food safety must be intensified with regard to research in the sensitive and ethical area of gene technology and its impact and implications for mankind.
There is a silent abhorrence of some of this research by citizens who expect us to reflect their concerns in this Parliament.
As I said on a previous occasion we should not play God with research.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, on behalf of the radical Members of the Bonino List, I would like to express my full support for the directive on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs.
It has taken three years - too many - from when Commissioner Santer, urged by Emma Bonino and Ritt Bjerregaard, the then Commissioners for Consumer Policy and the Environment, presented the proposal to amend the old Directive 90/220/EEC, a proposal which has resulted in the text we are debating today and upon which we are going to vote tomorrow.
We are going to vote in favour of the motion, for we feel that this proposal for a directive guarantees a rigorous legal framework for GMO authorisation, protecting consumers, economic operators and research scientists.
The proposal includes the major elements of innovation, environmental risk assessment and risk monitoring.
The new legislation also contains the precautionary principle, the rigid, ideological application of which, all too often proposed to us, would have the opposite effect to that desired, of paralysing not only research and innovation in the agri-foods sector but even commonly accepted aspects of our way of life, as the Italian Minister for Health, Umberto Veronesi, who is first and foremost a scientist, has pointed out in the last few days.
Improvements have been made in the areas of labelling and traceability, and a public information mechanism has been provided for.
On a more general note, it is my opinion that this directive represents a step forward in renouncing a prohibitionist approach to scientific progress.
Mr President, as well as the economic aspects, the new directive also expressly highlights the safety dimension, and rightly so.
As I have already pointed out on numerous occasions in earlier debates, we must pay particular attention to the ethical aspects of this sensitive issue.
Genetic modification of organisms constitutes interference with the characteristic properties of these organisms.
Given my belief that all these organisms were created by God, I recommend that we proceed with great caution.
We need to reflect on the ethical implications of the new developments in this sector.
Consideration of the ethical issues surrounding human genetics demonstrates that biotechnology can have far-reaching consequences.
Clear boundaries are essential in this respect.
I am delighted that the lion' s share of the amendments were included in the Council and Parliament joint text in the end.
It is to be welcomed that the environmental aspects now fall within the scope of the directive.
It is also important that the antibiotic-resistant markers are to be eliminated in the fullness of time.
The Council should approve the Cartagena Protocol without delay.
It is important for exports to third countries to be carried out in a proper manner.
The argument that the development of genetically modified organisms will help to solve the world food problem should actually be put into practice.
The stories about the so-called terminator gene, which is said to prevent children from growing, are very disturbing.
It is my hope that abuses and incorrect practices can be prevented through effective observance of the protocol.
Mr President, all in all, the joint text has my backing.
Mr President, after years of work on this report, we have now arrived at what I hope is a final position in Parliament.
We largely have Mr Bowe to thank for this.
The rapporteur has done a fantastic job.
In this connection, I want to congratulate him on the report.
Let us just remember that genetic engineering provides humanity with new, unguessed at opportunities.
Just as always in the past, however, new knowledge also entails new risks and increased responsibility.
It is important that we be aware of the risks and accept our responsibility.
This applies both to environmental issues and to ethical considerations.
At the same time, it is important to make it clear that, when it comes to improving people' s health and guaranteeing sustainable production of more food for a growing world population, we must not reject any form of science.
Instead, we must make use of science.
I would therefore simply urge that we make our decision in accordance with the proposal before us today.
Mr President, we refuse to endorse the draft directive which lays down the procedure for authorising genetically modified organisms, for fundamental reasons that I will set out in my explanation of vote, as well as for a very straightforward strategic reason.
It is because we are told that the implementation of this authorisation procedure, despite the fact that it is flawed, must be approved and we are also led to understand that the moratorium on authorisations, which was adopted by the Member State governments in June 1999, will be lifted pending the further information needed.
In these circumstances, we believe that it would be much wiser for Parliament to wait for the actual implementation of all the additional guarantees that the Commission is promising for tomorrow, such as a future text on the liability and requirement for insurance by those who release GMOs - I stress this point - or even a future improvement of the provisions on labelling and traceability.
On the other hand, if we approve the authorisation procedure today, there is a considerable risk that we will have been duped, if, tomorrow, we find that the moratorium is lifted on the sly - something that the Commission would love to see.
The debate is suspended.
The debate will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m.
Reform of the beef and veal market
The next item is the statement from the Commission on the proposals for the reform of the beef and veal market.
I give the floor to Commissioner Fischler.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to present the seven point plan to reform the beef and veal market which the Commission recently adopted.
What exactly is this plan?
We all know that the beef and veal market is in serious crisis; consumption in the European Union has plummeted; prices in Germany, for example, have fallen by 39.2% for steer and by 41.8% for cows.
These historic lows have already triggered the intervention safety net in Germany and the Netherlands.
In addition, our exports have, unfortunately, collapsed.
Fast action is called for.
Storing meat is clearly not enough per se.
It would result in an unmanageable beef mountain, quite apart from the fatal consequences for taxpayers, consumers and farmers.
We therefore also need fast reform.
The Commission's seven point plan is a sort of emergency package to prevent excess production over the next few years by taking another step towards extensive production, towards sustainability and towards organic farming.
However, this plan does not revolutionise the system completely for the simple reason that we first need to give our incipient reforms a chance.
Only a small part of the Agenda 2000 reform has really been implemented.
We have only just made the first step towards an overall 20% reduction in intervention prices, with a further 7.1% to follow this year and again next year.
The countermove - increasing direct payments and tripling the extensification premium - has still not entered into force by a long shot. In short, implementing Agenda 2000 fully in the year 2002 will by itself contribute towards extensive cattle-raising and less production-orientated subsidies.
Today we are discussing the emergency package as a result of BSE and this neither anticipates nor replaces the mid-term review of Agenda 2000.
I repeat, in 2002, i.e. next year, agricultural policy as a whole will be up for review, as demanded in Berlin.
The Commission will spend 2001 analysing individual sectors in detail, so that it can then present a comprehensive, well thought out concept for the future.
We need to take our time here if we are to avoid falling prey to hurried, political posturing.
The seven point plan will not take food out of the mouths of European farmers.
It is our only chance of mitigating farmers' loss of earnings, at least in the medium term.
The Commission cannot, unfortunately, afford to make up the loss of income in full.
Unsold beef, the lack of consumer confidence and escalating costs are a highly explosive mixture which could decimate beef-farming and agricultural policy.
Our seven point plan should allow us to remove the detonator from this ticking time-bomb.
But our plan should also ensure that beef and veal are safer than ever for consumers and that consumer confidence is restored in beef and veal.
Allow me now to outline these seven points briefly.
First, we propose to reduce the permissible stocking density for the special premium for steers and suckler cows from 2 to 1.8 livestock units.
Secondly, we want the Member States to respect the so-called 90-head limit without exception, i.e. a holding will only be paid the special beef premium for a maximum of 90 animals.
These two measures should increase the incentive for extensive farming.
Thirdly, in order to make organic farming more attractive, we propose to allow organic farmers to cultivate fodder such as clover on set-aside areas.
Fourthly, the Commission wants to set the number of rights for the special steer premium individually for each holding.
This measure will also act as an incentive to reduce intensive production.
Fifthly, our package also makes provision for a higher percentage - at least 20%, but no more than 40% - of animals which qualify for premiums, i.e. suckler cows, to be heifers.
This should also limit beef and veal production, which depends to a considerable degree on the number of suckler cows.
Sixthly and finally, we want to set the present ceiling for intervention outside the safety net of 350 000 tonnes for 2001 and 2002, in order to prevent prices from falling even further and the safety net from having to be used in other countries or over a longer period of time.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I say that the measures which the Commission is proposing here today will not take full hold for a year or two.
We have no alternative.
Beef and veal production is not akin to a light-bulb factory and the agricultural Commissioner is not a foreman who can turn off the production line and watch everything grind to a halt.
In the short term, we must consider what we are going to do with the huge quantities of unsold beef.
With all due respect for the ethical aspects, with all due sympathy for those who say that it is a tragedy to destroy the cattle, we must not delude ourselves.
Hundreds of thousands of cattle have been squashed into stalls in Europe for months because farmers cannot find anyone to buy their old livestock.
The safety net has already been deployed in two Member States.
This week alone we shall probably put up to 30 000 tonnes of meat into storage.
And yet none of this is enough.
That brings me to the last point of the package of measures.
As soon as compulsory BSE tests for animals over 30 months old have been introduced in all the Member States, we want to replace the programme of safe removal with a new special buy-up programme which allows the Member States to decide if they prefer to store beef at their own expense or if they want to remove this meat from the market straight away, in which case we and the Member States will compensate farmers jointly for the value of the animal in a ratio of 30% from the Member State and 70% from the EU.

This measure is no more than a provisional emergency measure and should not last beyond the end of this year.
In the medium term, there is only one way forward and that is: act today in order to limit beef production tomorrow, promote less intensive production methods and encourage organic farming.
I therefore ask you to return your opinion on today's proposal as quickly as possible.
Thank you for your attention.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement.
Mr President, Commissioner, it all sounds very hunky-dory, but a lot of it is cosmetic.
Why not go in for a proper reform and do away with endless quota regulations, ceilings, minimum and maximum livestock densities, slaughter premiums and fattening bonuses?
Why not just pay the farmers and say: you decide, do you want to slaughter the calves now, irrespective of how fat or thin they are, or do you want to get out of production completely?
Would that not be a more reasonable course of action?
And then I ask you: are you going to operate the guillotine - will you make it a rule that holdings with more than 90 animals will not get any subsidies?
Mr President, I would at least like to compliment the Commissioner on providing such a clear commentary.
I would mainly like to respond in my capacity as rapporteur for Budget 2001.
My first question is as follows: what will the additional cost of these measures be in animal premiums, over a period of four to five years?
According to provisional calculations, it will cost EUR 157 million this year and as much as EUR 1.75 billion over the years to come, and we are talking in terms of animal premiums.
My second question is does BSE have anything to do with the size of the farm?
I was under the impression that it did not, yet you have set a 90-animal limit per farm nonetheless.
That seems to me to be in conflict with an effective programme for fighting BSE.
Nor have I heard anything about a maximum premium per hectare, for the number of animals per hectare. Could you comment on that too?
You are going to dispense with the 350 000 ceiling on beef taken into intervention, which is in itself a good decision.
But could you comment on what the financial implications for the European Union are expected to be over the coming year?
Mr President, my warmest congratulations to you, Commissioner Fischler.
These measures are a step in the right direction.
They remain within the system, without changing the need to review the system for the next reform and take even more audacious action.
But this package sends out the right signal.
I have just one objection: why not divide up the bull premiums over a transitional period?
Half could be used to slaughter calves, i.e. for recovery, so it would not be Herod's premium, and the other half could be channelled into grasslands, to get into extensification, to get out of mass meat production and to achieve middle-of-the-road production.
I also note that the figure of 90 animals applies to every holding; holdings with more animals do not fall outside the rule, as the newspapers wrongly reported.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I promise to be much briefer.
In reply to Mrs Roth-Behrendt's questions - and this also applies to the others - we should be clear about one thing: what we are proposing here today is not a new agricultural reform.
As I, in fact, said.
Nor are we in a position to engage in agricultural reform at the moment.
I think it would be wrong if we were to look now at the reform of the beef and veal sector in isolation.
When we talk of agricultural reform - and we shall do so in good time, I can assure you, you will be hearing from us - then we must include, for example, the question of silage corn, the question of milk quotas, the question of what to do about dairy cattle versus beef cattle.
And there really is too little time for that, especially if you want to prepare something carefully.
What we have tabled here today is nothing more - but also nothing less - than a clear concept to get us out of the current crisis.
Now to Mrs Roth-Behrendt's question as to whether we should change over from quotas to direct payments.
There are no quotas for individual cattle fatteners under the current system.
First we need to introduce quotas for individual cattle fatteners; what you meant, I think, is that we should deregulate the whole thing and get into rural development.
But this is precisely the sort of question which can only be resolved in the context of a general debate on agricultural reform.
I personally - and I say so quite openly - am against the guillotine.
I am against any instrument of murder and hence I am also against the guillotine.
Which is why I favour seeing this 90-head limit as a franchise, by which I mean that everyone gets a subsidy up to 90 animals.
Mr Maat felt that was a contradiction because it makes no difference if it is a small or a large holding when it comes to BSE.
I think you are quite right.
But the 90-head limit is not a measure to fight BSE, it is a measure to create incentives for more extensive beef production in the future.
We have already looked into what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said about early marketing premiums.
The thing is, we had this sort of premium in 1996 and in later years.
We have calculated that this premium alone cost EUR 200 000 million.
Unfortunately, the end result is somewhat questionable, because 40% of calves are slaughtered with a low weight in any case.
That means we would pay nearly half the veal farmers a premium with absolutely no end result.
Which is why we have shunned this measure, especially in view of our limited resources.
Mr President, Commissioner, now that the Greens are finally in clover, does it not make sense to choose the much easier path through the whole complicated premium structure by going for a climate-related grassland premium and forgetting the rest?
Secondly, Commissioner, I should like to point out that one point needs greater clarification because otherwise, I think, the internal market will fall apart.
If, as it would appear, the costs of disposing of bonemeal and material from slaughtered animals are not clarified uniformly in the Member States, and are partly taken up by government levies and partly passed on to farmers through prices, how do you intend to resolve this problem?
Otherwise we shall not be able to keep the internal market together.
Commissioner Fischler, I agree with you when you talk about extensification, but I do not endorse the measures that you are proposing because, ultimately, they will not facilitate extensification.
If you are in favour of this approach, why do you not do the following: end subsidies for production and then pay in proportion to the least amount of animals per hectare?
Then you will actually be bringing about the extensification of the sector because, otherwise, by maintaining aid for production, you are implementing a contradictory policy: on the one hand you are encouraging production and on the other, you are paying for it.
This system defies belief!
The second question I wish to ask you is this: given that this sector is undergoing a profound crisis and that there is an EAGGF-Guarantee, half of which is, in practice, spent on just one type of production, I should like to ask Commissioner Fischler whether it is not time to require...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, I have three brief questions.
My first question is that you admittedly spoke about measures on organic farming, but what do you intend to do about all the certified and approved products, which are also subjected to very strict criteria?
My second question relates to calves. What are you doing or what do you intend to do about rearing calves with their mother, because, currently, milk given to calves that are 'battery farmed' also presents problems that you have not considered.
Lastly, my third question is what are you going to do to avoid measures likely to penalise only small farmers without affecting large farmers?
Mr President, first on the question of grasslands, grassland premiums or, first and foremost, general permission to use set-aside areas.
I think that we need to tread somewhat carefully here.
We must not forget that organic farms by definition produce much less and that the organic farming system automatically has a built-in brake on production so to speak.
If we generally abandon the brake on production in the cereals sector, then we no longer meet the requirements for a bluebox measure.
Which is why I think we need to tread carefully.
As far as introducing a general grassland premium in lieu of a beef premium is concerned, we discussed this in connection with Agenda 2000.
I have no objection in principle here, but there is a feasibility problem, because you must admit one thing: a meadow in Schleswig-Holstein cannot be treated in the same way as a hectare of meadow in northern Finland or a meadow in southern Portugal.
There are huge differences in yield, quality and requirements.
But Europe does not have a system for evaluating these differences, which is why we need to consider this question at greater length.
But, as I said, I have no objection in principle, just a feasibility problem.
As far as the question of disposal costs is concerned, the fact is that very different systems are currently being applied here.
In some Member States it is done through tax measures, in other Member States the costs are simply absorbed by the national budget and in others still the farmers, or at least the agricultural sector, is left to pick up the tab.
Since these are national measures, national assistance rules apply.
And we are doing that, we have accepted that.
However, not all Member States have sent in their replies as requested, not by a long chalk.
But, hopefully, we should be in a position by the next Council to formulate a more accurate overview.
However, and I must stress this, a certain self-discrimination by the Member States within the framework of government aid cannot be prohibited under Community law.
That is also a fact of life.
But I agree with you, that it should not be allowed to go too far as, otherwise, we really shall create two types of farmholding or two types of farmer in Europe.
In reply to the question on certified products: the certification of products is set out in the provisions which we introduced on 1 September last year.
It was agreed, with Parliament's consent, that this would be done in two stages.
The first stage is in force and the second will follow on 1 January next year.
However, this second stage must already be complied with for any meat which enters storage.
Because if we do not insist on this now, we will not be able to remove this meat from storage after 1 January 2002 because it will no longer meet labelling requirements.
Then there is also national certification.
This national certification, which is carried out by CHA in Germany or SOPEXA in France, is subject to a notification requirement.
In other words, these certifications must be notified.
Then there is also private certification.
These private certifications are governed solely by the principle of truth.
This means that the truth must be told about what is written on the outside of a product.
With products involving government aid, certain rules must be respected.
We are currently reforming this system, because we quite clearly take the view that the fact that a product comes from a particular region is no automatic guarantee of quality and that quality has to be defined.
Only if the quality is right and only if it is checked can we talk of a proper quality label.
But we have difficulties here - I freely admit - with combinations of quality and origin, when it is suggested that the quality automatically goes up if a specific product comes from a specific region.
As far as calves' milk is concerned - and I assume that you are basically referring to milk replacer here - the relevant adaptations are being prepared.
However, they come within the remit of my colleague Commissioner Byrne.
As far as the implementation of the White Paper on food security is concerned, suitable proposals will also be forthcoming here.
Mr President, I have three short questions to ask Mr Fischler.
One of the questions I am often asked is if one case of BSE breaks out in a herd of dairy cows, why does the entire herd have to be slaughtered?
The systems vary from country to country in Europe.
What is the Commission' s view on this?
Is it necessary or not, or is it just a precautionary measure?
The way in which the tests are funded varies from country to country.
Is that good for the unity of the market and if not, is the Commission planning to do something about it?
Thirdly, we still import large quantities of beef from outside Europe.
How does the Commission ensure that these cattle have not been fed animal meal, and are the controls adequate?
Mr President, Commissioner, in one of your proposals you referred to the possibility of cultivating clover on fallow land, but you will understand that in the countries of the South this is not always possible and is sometimes very difficult.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you could adapt this good proposal to the countries of the South, so that it would be attractive to them and would allow the viability, for example, of cultivating pulses in these conditions.
My second question, Commissioner, is how do you explain the difference between slaughter premiums which currently exist?
There are countries whose slaughter premium is currently double that of others.
I would like you to explain, Commissioner, how this issue is calculated, in order to prevent these enormous disparities: sometimes double in one place in relation to another.
Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner three questions.
How soon does he think the 350 000 ceiling on beef taken into intervention will be passed and how far does he expect it to go?
Is it not better to incinerate animals over 30 months old rather than start putting too much of this old beef into intervention?
Finally, I do not understand the 90-animal limit because surely extensification, greening the agricultural policy is the way forward.
I can take the Commissioner to many farms in the UK where there are over 90 cattle being raised on an extensive-type regime and to smaller farms where cattle are intensively produced.
So surely it is the extensification payment that should be altered, not this 90-animal ceiling.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in reply to Mr Mulder's question on slaughtering herds: there is no Community provision which prescribes that the herd must always be slaughtered if a case of BSE occurs in it.
Several options have been created here and a derogation should also be permitted in the future.
What is important to the Commission is that there should be a plan of what will be done if a case of BSE occurs.
This plan must be notified to the Commission and will be evaluated by the Commission's scientific committees. If the committees consider the plan acceptable, it is automatically approved by the Commission.
This system has worked perfectly so far.
As far as the costs of the test are concerned, may I remind you once again of what I said earlier in reply to Mr Böge's question.
As far as massive imports of meat into Europe are concerned, I would qualify the term "massive" somewhat, because relatively little beef is imported into the European Union.
The question of removing risk material and, more importantly, the question of whether the meat is from animals which were tested and whether the country in question guarantees that the animals were not fed with feedingstuffs containing meat and bonemeal are clear and this must be implemented accordingly.
The Commission is currently working on the relevant proposals and my colleague Commissioner Byrne is working on this.
Now, I fail to see how Mr Jové Peres can say that slaughter premiums in the South are twice or several times higher.
That is news to me.
The slaughter premiums are the same everywhere.
In reply to Mr Jové Peres' question: we do not want to incinerate meat arbitrarily; we want to store this meat, provided that it is quality meat.
This disposal scheme is for meat which cannot be stored, which is not eligible for intervention; because only meat from steer qualifies for intervention, not meat from old cows.
There has been a great deal of criticism here.
We had suggested disposing of the meat from old cows, but we want to take account of this criticism and we therefore now offer two options: either a Member State does as Great Britain has done over the past five years - and this has also worked perfectly in a number of other Member States - or a Member State has the option of buying this old livestock.
If it believes it can manufacture products from it, then obviously they must never go into commercial circulation, because first we cannot pay the full value of the animal and, secondly, this meat will then be competing with normal meat.
That is out of the question, but if there is additional recovery potential here and if individual Member States see such potential, then they may make use of it.
The 90-head limit does not apply to cows, only to subsidies under the special beef premium; only stocks or rather only up to 90 animals a year are subsidised and no more.
That is the ratio.
For the rest, we also made this suggestion in connection with Agenda 2000.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to stress that I am grateful to see Point 7, the special purchasing programme.
It makes the position clear.
This means that tests are carried out before storage, and above all each Member State can make its own decision.
I am very grateful for that.
That creates a very acceptable basis for debate.
I have a question concerning the stocking density.
The ratio of forage area to cereal is 2.0 to 1.8 - so do I automatically increase the base area to give farmers an opportunity to further improve their living by growing cereals?
Now for my second question.
And I would like to welcome Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf with his bow tie, maybe that is a reference to the fact that he now has clover grass, but we could also use Lucerne grass, that is just as good. Can you tell me why we do not use pulses, which we urgently need as a substitute for animal meal in these areas, and why does everything necessarily have to be organic?
Commissioner, you said that the European Union was unable to compensate farmers for their losses.
I cannot believe that Europe would be prepared to abandon them in their plight.
How are you planning to resolve this?
My second question is that you outlined to us a plan to unleash and rebalance the market on what consumer estimates was this based, 10%, 20% or 25% less?

My third point concerns the cultivation of protein-rich crops on set-aside land. What impact do you expect this to have on reducing our deficit and our level of imports?
Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner whether there is anything that the Commission can do to encourage the removal of the older animals from the national herd?
It is obvious from the testing that has been taking place, at least in my own country, that all of the younger animals and animals over 30 months that have been tested are not in any way reacting positively to the test.
So it is important to remove the older animals.
Can the Commission encourage the removal of those older animals?
Mr President, I have already pointed out why only organic farms can be considered for planting clover or clover grass. By the way, I am sure that Lucerne is also included, I see no problem with that.
It is vital to bear in mind that we should not let this measure undermine our WTO commitments, or else the whole thing will collapse and we will have achieved the exact opposite of what we want to achieve, because in that case we would not be able to help our farmers, and we would actually be harming them.
As regards growing high-protein feed in the form of field beans and field peas and so forth, we have undertaken to investigate this whole issue from the demand side as well as from the supply side.
This investigation is under way.
It is too late for the present production year anyway, because changes to the existing market regime would be needed in any case, and from a purely technical point of view it is too late to do that before these high-protein plants are planted.
So this is only achievable for the next production year, and that means that we still have time to carry out a proper investigation.
As far as imports are concerned, it is true to say that we annually import - chiefly from South America at present - around 30 million tonnes of soya and other high-protein feeds.
The shortfall which has now arisen in the form of 2.5 million tonnes of meat and bonemeal amounts to less than 10% of that.
It is also necessary, and no final decision has been taken on this yet, to check whether this ban on feeding animal and bone meal to pigs and poultry will remain in force or whether the ban will be modified.
In this connection, my colleague Commissioner Byrne is currently having inspections carried out in all 15 Member States to establish whether there are models that already work or whether there are problems with checks everywhere.
So I cannot yet give a definitive reply on this.
Turning to Mr Hyland's question about tests, let me make one thing crystal clear: our first goal must always be to guarantee consumer safety.
That is why we believe that it is of paramount importance for all animals over 30 months old to be tested, even if individual animals then have to be disposed of.
Why?
Because we otherwise run the risk, if we leave this totally in the hands of the Member States or the sector itself, that there will be a kind of pre-selection between those animals that are tested and those animals that people do not want to test.
That implies certain risks which we want to avoid at all costs.
Our aim is to bring forward the date of 1 July so that all animals over 30 months old are tested in all Member States as from 1 April at the latest.
That means that the alternative I have presented to you here can also be put into practice.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for the answers you have given to all these questions.
That concludes the debate.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0007/2001).
We will examine questions to the Commission.
Mr Izquierdo Collado has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, as you know, in today's Question Time there is a question of mine relating to widespread fraud in the flax industry, with thousands of millions of euros being gained fraudulently.
In the question I ask the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, for his opinion of the political responsibility of Mrs Loyola de Palacio following the report of the Spanish prosecutor, which confirms this fraud.
Mr President, this point of order is to ask you for express support in relation to what I am going to say. As well as finding it incredible that this question has not been considered a priority for an oral reply, I would like to tell you that, although it is reserved for a written answer, I already have in my hands a written reply, because a newspaper in my country has already stated: "In his written reply to a question put by the Socialist MEP, Juan de Dios Izquierdo, Mr Prodi has indicated that, on the basis of documents available to the Commission, he can only reaffirm his full confidence in Mrs de Palacio.
Furthermore, in response to another Socialist question on the possibility that the case may destabilise the entire executive, etc."
Mr President, I have not yet received the written reply, as you might expect, and yet I have it here.
I do not think that it requires much imagination to know which group has been behind the scenes, applying pressure so that my question should not be given an oral reply in Parliament and so that this newspaper should already know Mr Prodi's precise reply.
Mr President, I would ask you to investigate the situation and to protect the Members of this Parliament, because this is not an example of the transparency which Mr Prodi promised us at the beginning of his mandate.
Mr Izquierdo, I am President for this sitting, as you know, I am not the President of Parliament.
Nor is it likely that I will ever be President of Parliament.
I will communicate your speech to the President, and I can tell you that the President has received a letter from you and another one from Mr Berenguer.
I believe that you will have received a reply from the President, which has probably been sent by fax.
In it, I believe that the President - who, pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure, is assisted by her office, which is empowered to allow and put the questions in order - replies, and I have the reply before me, by pointing out the criteria she has used to put the questions in order.
In short, I can tell you that the President and the services considered that the question was addressed to Mr Prodi, and he was not expected to attend the plenary sitting.
The President of the Commission does not usually attend this Question Time.
There are a number of Commissioners, including Mr Kinnock and Mr Byrne, who we know in advance will reply to questions.
This is communicated to the Members of the European Parliament and they therefore ask specific questions.
Furthermore, the President of Parliament has decided, as well as considering the chronological order, to select the five questions which, in her judgment, are priorities and urgent, which are the five which make up the first part and which we are going to deal with now.
That is the explanation I can give you, with complete transparency.
In any event, I take note of your comments, which will appear in the Minutes, and I regret that a newspaper from any country can make statements on written or oral replies which are yet to be given.
Mr Berenguer has the floor for a point of order.
I would ask him to be as concise as possible.
Mr President, since I have been mentioned by the presidency, I would like to say that I have in fact received a reply, which I do not agree with. I do not agree with the presidency's interpretation of the questions made by Members of this House.
I do not agree with it because it seems that that interpretation can be seen as a way of reducing the legitimate initiatives of Members to monitor the Commission.
My question specifically asked whether the Commission - not the President, but the Commission - felt threatened by the words of a Spanish MEP, a member of the People's Party, in which he said that, if the Socialists criticised Mrs de Palacio for her involvement in the flax scandal which took place in Spain when she was Minister for Agriculture, they would threaten to bring down the Commission.
If this is not considered by the presidency to be a priority, if this is not a question which, because it is not considered a priority, could not be answered by, for example, Vice-President Kinnock, then I am truly amazed.
In any event, and while I express my disagreement, this is not what I wanted to say.
Like my colleague, Mr Izquierdo, who was requesting support from the presidency, I wanted to say that it was unacceptable for replies addressed to Members of this House to be published in a pro-government newspaper in Spain, before the Members are made aware of that reply.
And, while strongly protesting at this anomaly, I would ask you to consider my question withdrawn.
I do not want the Commission to reply to the ABC newspaper before replying to me.
And since I do not want the Commission to go through the shame of having to notify the Spanish press of its replies before the Members to whom they are addressed, I am not going to participate in this behaviour and I withdraw my question.
Thank you very much, Mr Berenguer.
I am not thanking you for having withdrawn your question, naturally, but for having brought your speech to a close.
I cannot make any value judgment since, furthermore, I share the nationality and electoral constituency of the Members who have asked the question, on the issues raised.
I am acting as President of the sitting of the European Parliament and the support that I can offer Mr Izquierdo Collado is, of course, to communicate his comments to the President of Parliament so that she may hear them directly.
Furthermore, Mr Izquierdo Collado has whichever channels open to him that he considers appropriate to make this protest, shall we say.
Part I
Question No 45 by (H-0014/01):
Subject: Consequences of the use of depleted uranium bombs in Kosovo Intense concern has been caused in Europe by revelations concerning the development of leukaemia among members of the international forces who served in Bosnia and Kosovo, which has been attributed to the use of depleted uranium bombs.
In reply to one of my previous questions (H-0429/99) the Commission indicated that (a) the report by the Regional Environmental Centre for Central and Eastern Europe had been forwarded to the Environment Ministers of the Member States in June 1999 and (b) detailed analysis of the situation regarding funding for clean-up measures had not yet been carried out.
In view of the fact that no answers to this particular issue were forthcoming at the January part-session and that the Commissioner referred to a meeting of an independent group of experts, does the Commission not consider highly alarming the implications of the report for the health of civilians and servicemen in these areas?
Who will assume responsibility for medical examination programmes for the populations of the areas affected by depleted uranium bombs?
What are the conclusions of the meeting of independent experts to which the Commissioner referred and what additional measures are to be taken?
The Commission refers the honourable Member to the statement given by Commissioner Wallström to the plenary session of this House on 17 January.
Since that date the Commission has convened a meeting of the group of experts established under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health consequences of the use of depleted uranium.
The report of that group will be ready in a few weeks' time.
The World Health Organisation will also issue a report on the subject in the near future.
The Commission will then consider appropriate action to be taken in the light of the scientific evidence produced by these activities.
In response to the particular questions of the honourable Member, the Member States of the Union have not informed the Commission of their actions taken following receipt of the Regional Environmental Centre report.
The Commission has no plans to initiate medical examination programmes.
As the honourable Member will know, it is a regrettable fact that the people of the region face a variety of threats to health from several sources and some of those threats are obviously environmental in origin.
Within the means at its disposal the Commission is working with the United Nations mission in Kosovo - Unmik - through the European Agency for Reconstruction, to eliminate these threats according to priorities for intervention.
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
Although it was somewhat general, I should like to ask if the few weeks which the report from the independent committee is expected to take can be narrowed down?
Also, in order to break the general thrust of his reply a little, can the interventions to deal with the extremely serious environmental repercussions for the people in the area be quantified and specified?
Mr President, in response to Mr Alavanos's first question, I am informed that the report from the expert committee that is being convened under the Euratom Treaty will be published within weeks rather than months, so it is in the relatively near future.
As regards the detailed response that is justified to the question on health problems, there is a great deal of material at the Commission and certainly I, or indeed my responsible colleagues, would be happy to give full details to the honourable Member of whatever is at their disposal.
This would be rather more useful than my trying to make a recitation in the limited time available in this House.
Mr President, Commissioner, at yesterday' s meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, we did indeed hear Mr Haavisto who prepared his report on the results of the group of experts.
On the other hand, although he spoke about depleted uranium, he made absolutely no mention of the statement made by NATO on 18 January, in which it was admitted that, in addition to depleted uranium, plutonium had also been used.
Are you planning to undertake plutonium tests in the region and do you intend to make European Union funds available in order to carry out decontamination work?
Mr President, as I indicated in my first answer, there are certain budgetary limitations that have the effect of restricting some of the actions that we undertake in the region, not only as the Commission but also in our cooperative activities with other organisations.
I am certain that the honourable Member recognises the nature of those limitations.
It therefore means that on some occasions it is quite probable that the activities to secure decontamination and protection for public health are not as extensive as, ideally, we would like them to be.
The fact remains, however, that the Commission, acting on behalf of the Union, is probably the lead actor in all the activities to improve conditions of public health and to provide for decontamination and environmental protection.
So far as the NATO statement of last month on plutonium is concerned, I am not in a position to give a comprehensive answer at this stage.
I am certain that if the honourable Member wanted to write explicitly on the NATO statement and the possibility of the use of plutonium and its side effects in that region, either in the course of acts of war or otherwise, my colleagues in the Commission would be more than ready to provide a comprehensive reply.
I invite the honourable Member either to write directly to me on the subject - and I will certainly see it gets to the right quarters - or to take it up directly either in the committee of which he is a member or specifically with one of my fellow Commissioners.
Question No 46 by (H-0055/01):
Subject: Radioactive pollution of the Aegean and the Ionian Seas According to reports in the Greek press, as well as in the Turkish press, according to Le Journal du Dimanche, depleted uranium shells have been used by the Greek and the Turkish navies in exercises in the Aegean and the Ionian Seas for the last ten years.
The inhabitants of the islands and along the coastlines of these two seas, as well as the citizens of neighbouring countries, are concerned about possible radioactive pollution, because sea currents carry radioactivity beyond the area where the shells were fired.
Does the Commission intend to set up an independent commission to investigate this matter and to inform the inhabitants of these regions and all the citizens of Europe about the real state of affairs so as to prevent an 'Aegean syndrome' taking hold, whether or not it is justified?
Does it intend to work towards this goal with the governments concerned?
What preventative measures does it intend to take?
Mr President, the Commission's attention was given to the use of depleted uranium in armour-piercing shells as long ago as 1993.
At that time, the Commission's reply to Parliament related to the specific issue of the test-firing of shells in coastal waters, and it offered the view that such action would not have a significant impact on the environment.
The Commission continues to hold that view on the basis of the evidence that, in the marine environment, the only exposure pathway is the slow dissolution of uranium.
It is important to note that the amount of uranium that could be dissolved is very small compared to the natural abundance of uranium in all sea-water.
The movement of uranium away from the test-firing location by tides and currents could not, therefore, be distinguished from natural background concentrations.
The Commission understands public concern about the use of depleted uranium materials for military purposes.
However, the Commission draws attention to the fact that the firing of uranium penetrators at land-based targets has implications which are different from those of firing ammunition in the marine environment, because use on land can result in the dispersion of uranium oxides which may subsequently be inhaled, whilst that is clearly not the case in the marine environment.
Commissioner, am I to conclude, from what I understood of your reply, that the Commission believes that there is no cause for concern and that it has no intention of looking into this?
Have I understood correctly?
Is that what you meant?
That the citizens have no cause for concern and that there are no dangerous quantities of uranium in these seas?
Mr President, it is not a question of the Commission in any sense being complacent, either politically - because it is responsible to the public - or indeed scientifically.
The points that I made in my earlier response related to the natural concentrations of uranium in sea-water of all descriptions and in all locations.
On the basis of that scientific reality the feeling of the Commission and all other scientifically advised persons and bodies is that the evidence of uranium deposit in sea-water is such that the firing of shells for target purposes in the marine environment does not make any significant addition to uranium concentrations.
It is only on the basis of that widely accepted and well-documented scientific evidence that the Commission takes its view.
In addition, I did draw attention in my first answer to the strong distinction that has to be made between possible consequences of the use of depleted uranium material and munitions in a land environment where the oxides can be inhaled, and in a maritime environment where the consequences of the use of depleted uranium do not have the same consequences, since obviously no inhalation can take place.
Mr President, I am amazed by the Commission's reply and greatly fear that it may soon be contradicted, just as similar assurances on previous occasions have been contradicted.
These shells have been used in tens of thousands of military exercises and have exploded in the air, not just in the water.
That means that gases will have been carried both to the inhabited islands and to the inhabited shores of Turkey.
I am amazed at how the Commission can come here with what I can only describe as an offhand manner and assure us that, because they fall into the sea, these depleted uranium shells do not cause any problem.
In all honesty, I can find no explanation for these statements, Mr President.
What can I say?
All that is left is for me to condemn yet another attempt to conceal a crime perpetrated not just in Yugoslavia but during NATO exercises.
And there you have it.
Can I draw the honourable Member's attention to the title of the question he set down earlier.
The title of the question was "Radioactive pollution of the Aegean and Ionian Seas".
The answer was given, not only now but as long ago as 1993, based very heavily on strong scientific evidence in relation to that question. If the honourable Member has evidence to support the contention that there has been damage as a consequence of target firing, either to the coasts of Greece or indeed of Turkey, or to islands in the Aegean or Ionian Seas, I know, that as a conscientious Member, he will want to put down questions or make representations on that specific basis.
If and when he does - and I am answering the question - I will give him the basis for a scientific view of what the consequences of the use of depleted uranium are in those circumstances.
He will understand, however, that without notice of that question I am hardly in a position to give him the detail that he would want on the specific environmental questions that he raises.
I am certain that he would not, as a responsible Member of the European Parliament, want to contest serious scientific opinion or indeed be alarmist in a way that would be upsetting to his constituents.
Question No 47 by (H-0037/01):
Subject: Serbia and the Common Foreign and Security Policy The Parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia recently passed an amnesty law covering those refusing to serve in the people's army and prisoners convicted of criminal acts against the army or of 'anti-state activities'.
According to statements by the Yugoslav Minister of Justice Moncílo Grubac on 9 January, this amnesty law does not apply to those convicted of terrorism.
That means that around 700 Albanian Kosovar prisoners cannot obtain amnesty, having been convicted of 'terrorism'.
What is the Commission's response to Yugoslavia's refusal to release the Albanian prisoners?
What action does the Commission intend to take in order to see to it that the formal pledge given by Yugoslavia (cf. statements by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Goran Svilanovic in Washington and promises made by President Kostuníca vis-à-vis the EU) is observed, and all Albanian political prisoners are released?
The honourable Member is correct in stating that the proposed amnesty law, which is still only a proposal before both the Serbian Parliament and the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will not cover anyone convicted of offences considered to be acts of terrorism.
The European Union has already repeatedly called for the release of all Albanian Kosovar prisoners.
The EU ministerial troika which visited Belgrade on 8 February also expressed concern at the fact that the proposed amnesty law will not cover all those convicted of political offences by the Milosevic regime.
The Commission has been fully involved in these initiatives, and the European Parliament's ad hoc delegation, which visited from 8 to 10 February, also raised this issue in the relevant quarters.
The Serbian and federal authorities have indicated their intention to urgently re-examine the cases of those not covered by the law, particularly to ascertain whether the convictions are sound or not.
As of today, the prisoners have still, regrettably, not been released.
The EU will keep up the pressure to ensure that they are.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer and his words of encouragement, but what we have to take on board is that we are in a transitional phase at the moment, when it comes to EU aid to Serbia. We are in the transitional phase between emergency aid and aid which is more structural in nature.
I believe we have well and truly reached a point where we can start banging the table for a while.
There is a great deal of scepticism on the part of the Albanian Kosovars towards the Kostuníca regime.
The people are getting rather desperate.
There have been hunger strikes.
The people now want to see real progress.
I understand there is an adviser from the Commission amongst Mr Kostuníca' s immediate entourage, a man who has already won his spurs amongst the President of Montenegro' s entourage I might add.
What I would like the Commission to do is exploit this transitional period to the full by telling Serbia that we are not going to carry on delivering aid unless they solve this pressing problem.
I certainly understand the instincts of and the rationale offered by Mr Staes, and not for the first time.
I can give him the assurance that all influences and all means of representation are being employed in the most forceful possible way in order to try and secure the outcome that the Commission, the Union generally and Members of this House - including Mr Staes - want and that would be consistent with humane and just treatment.
The Commission, however, is not disposed, certainly at this juncture, to contemplate the possibility of sanctions of various kinds, including the ones suggested by the honourable Member, simply because the Commission is making its contribution and its commitment on behalf of the Union in full knowledge of the dire needs of people and organisations in that area.
We very much hope that by using the means that are currently being employed we will, without great delay, secure the outcomes which will serve the interests of humanity and be consistent with the views continually expressed by the Union, the Commission and this House.
Mr President, I believe that the legal basis on which the Commission is working is totally inadequate.
Mr Hækkerup was very clear - there is absolutely no need for an amnesty law by the Belgrade authorities, since only the UN, represented by Mr Hækkerup, can decide whether to imprison, sentence, or continue to detain these people.
The only issue to consider is their immediate release from Serbian prisons and their transfer to the UN mission in Kosovo.
There is therefore no need for the Commission to put pressure on Mr Kostuníca to pass an amnesty law or to enter into a set-up which is completely illegal in international law.
The Commission and Council must make Mr Kostuníca and Mr Djinjic comply with the orders of the international community, which is demanding the return of the 700 hostages to the UN authorities.
I would like to know what the Commission intends to do about this.
Whilst I have absolutely no reason to doubt the figure given by the honourable Member, there are different estimates.
The official estimate of the number of prisoners affected in this specific area and this specific instance is 300, rather than 700.
The point that we continually try to make in our representations is that regardless of the precise numbers there is a principle of humanity to be followed, and we want to see it applied without any further delay.
However, whilst I understand the argumentation over the legal base, we would be further complicating an already delicate situation if we were to seek to act in a peremptory fashion or advise others - including the United Nations - that they should do that.
Clearly there is less patience now than yesterday, and there was less yesterday than last week.
That feeling is being strongly communicated in the relevant quarters.
But it would be irresponsible and misleading of me to indicate that we are going to make any major departure from the course that we have followed and have every reason to believe we can produce a successful and humane conclusion.
Question No 48 by (H-0069/01):
Subject: Arrest of children in Turkey According to the Union of Human Rights, 29 children aged between 9 and 16 years of age have recently been arrested in Diyarbakir in Turkey on charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation and imprisoned.
The Union for Human Rights maintains that the children have been mistreated and need immediate psychological assistance.
They are now in danger of being tried and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.
What measures will the Commission take in response to this in connection with negotiations for the accession of Turkey with a view to securing the immediate release of these young children and convincing Turkey finally to respect the undertakings which it has made to the EU concerning the introduction of greater democracy in social and political terms?
Mr President, the Commission is aware of the arrest of 28 children and young people in Turkey described in Mrs Zorba's question.
According to our information, 28 children and young people were arrested by the police in a small town in south-east Turkey on 9 January.
The local security forces alleged that these children had taken part in an illegal demonstration, that they had shouted out pro-PKK slogans, and that they had protested against the Turkish military presence in northern Iraq.
Children and young people aged between 9 and 16 were arrested and taken to a prison in Diyarbakir.
According to information provided by the Turkish Union for Human Rights, these children have also been mistreated in prison.
Following protests by the parents and the Turkish Human Rights Society, 22 children and young people have now been released, but six young people aged between 14 and 17 are still in custody.
The Commission has made representations to the Turkish authorities on this matter in the strongest terms.
The Commission has called for an immediate and full explanation of the facts.
This incident is a matter of grave concern to us.
The Commission wishes to emphasise that whatever these children may be accused of, such accusations can in no way justify taking children into custody, throwing them into a prison far from their parental homes and detaining them there for several days.
This kind of behaviour is totally irreconcilable with the human rights standards prevailing in the European Union.
The Commission expects the Turkish Government to address this matter immediately. This incident demonstrates that there is an urgent need for political reform in Turkey if that country is to move closer to the European Union and its values.
The Commission recalls that comprehensive protection of human rights is one of the political criteria that the candidate countries must meet in order to open accession negotiations with the European Union.
This is also reflected in the priorities of the Accession Partnership with Turkey presented by the Commission in November last year.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Your reply was most satisfactory.
However, given that the public prosecutor has referred the case, calling for these six children to be sentenced to up to five years' imprisonment on the basis of the charges, I should like to know if there is something else we can do and exactly how long you intend to wait.
Mrs Zorba, unfortunately I cannot confirm that the process has started at all and that penalties have been called for as part of the process.
I know that the Turkish Government has made direct contact with the criminal prosecution authorities, but we do not know the outcome of that contact between the Turkish Government and the local authorities.
I am certainly willing, Mrs Zorba, to intervene in this matter once again at whatever level you consider appropriate.
And I believe that will be useful, because strong international pressure and intense international interest are the only things that really help in such cases.
I congratulate the Commissioner on his reply.
However, he talks about EU values and standards.
In response to questions I put about the continuation of the bombing of Iraq and sanctions on Iraq, the Commission showed no concern for the fact that 5 to 6 000 children have died because of sanctions on Iraq.
So when I hear the Commission talk about EU values and standards, in view of its support for sanctions on Iraq I wonder how sincere it is about the children in Turkey.
Mr President, I am sorry, but I fail to see the connection between the question of United Nations sanctions on Iraq and the arrest of 28 children in Turkey.
Question No 49 by (H-0085/01):
Subject: Safety of childcare products In Sweden in particular, criticism has been levelled against EU rules on safety requirements for childcare products.
Consumers have substantially less say in the standardisation process than industry.
Certain products with which children come into contact are not currently safe enough.
The aim should be to ensure that such products are inherently safe and do not require constant parental supervision.
What are the Commission's views regarding the current standardisation process and the balance of power between consumers and industry, and can we expect that the objectives of the mandates for children's articles and other products pursuant to the product safety directive will be achieved and become reality?
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Kinnock
The Commission is fully aware of the importance of the participation of consumer representatives in the standardisation of work.
The importance of the participation of all interested parties in the process has been recognised in several resolutions and communications.
The Commission is actively supporting this through different initiatives.
In particular, the Commission gives important annual financing support, amounting to EUR 830 000 in 2001, to the European Association for the Coordination of Consumer Representation in Standardisation - the organisation known as ANEC.
It is also important that consumer organisations identify this subject as a priority in order to allocate the necessary resources.
The Commission also encourages the Member States and the standardisation bodies to facilitate the participation of consumers in the standardisation process, at national level as well.
The general product safety directive, which aims at ensuring that products placed on the market are safe, gives a specific role to European standards.
This role is reinforced in the new version which is about to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament.
In order to elaborate these standards the Commission will give to the European standardisation bodies standardisation mandates in which the level of safety to be achieved will be specified.
Consumer organisations will be consulted on the content of the mandates.
The Commission will verify that the standards developed comply with the requirements of the directive and the mandates, both when it comes to aspects related to safety and to the participation of consumers, before the publication of the references of the standards in the Official Journal.
The Commission will carefully check that all the standardisation mandates under the directive, in particular those relating to children's products, are satisfactorily executed.
Issues such as this are always kept under review.
As you are aware, the general product safety directive is the overall framework legislation that deals with this issue.
My services and I keep a very close eye on how the legislation is implemented, throughout the European Union, to ensure that consumers - and children, in particular - are protected from dangerous products.
You will be aware that there is a safety measure contained within the general product safety directive; that was the measure used last year when we brought forward a safeguard measure relating to phthalates in children's toys.
That is one of the measures that can be used by way of an emergency measure to protect children.
Could I briefly ask the Commissioner if he can be specific now on an issue many of us, including Mrs Hulthén, have raised with him before, that is the potential dangers of plastic inedibles which are given away with sweets and other things and which are not a foodstuff.
They are a plastic, but they are not really designated as one or the other.
Is he confident now that these substances are actually safe for children?
I am aware, Mr Whitehead, that this is an issue in which you have a particular interest and it has been an issue which you and my services have consulted on for some time.
But it is an issue which is being dealt with by DG Enterprise and my colleague, Mr Liikanen.
The Commission has recently been questioned on the safety of associated products, often consisting in a toy accompanying the food product in a separate background.
In the light of the information collected by the Commission in cooperation with national authorities, the Emergency Committee of the General Products Safety Directive reached on 16 May 2000 the conclusion that no specific danger relating to the associated product has been identified.
Non-food items, particularly small toys, or toys containing small parts are not risk-free.
However, the risk would depend on the characteristics of the non-food product itself.
The existence of a possible risk has convinced the Emergency Committee to explore the need to reinforce the existing instruments, particularly the protection offered by Directive 88/378 on safety of toys and the related standard EN 71/1.
The competent services of the Commission are currently working on possible improvements.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 50, 51 and 52 will be taken together.
Question No 50 by (H-0057/01):
Subject: Alleged attempt by Commissioner Kinnock to gag ex-Commissioner Gradin According to reports appearing in the Swedish press on 23 January, Commissioner Kinnock wrote to ex-Commissioner Gradin and her former chef de cabinet, Christer Asp, demanding explanations concerning comments they made about shortcomings in the way the Commission operates.
After the resignation of the Santer Commission and the Buitenen affair, people thought the Commission had learnt the meaning of democratic openness and had stopped using authoritarian methods to gag its employees past and present.
Will the Commission therefore say whether it is true that Commissioner Kinnock wrote such letters? What steps will it take to prevent a repeat of gaffes like this?
Question No 51 by (H-0081/01):
Subject: Commission's conduct in regard to freedom of expression Former Commissioner Anita Gradin and the former head of her private office, Christer Asp, have been criticised in a letter from the Commission for having given public interviews to clarify how several million in aid intended for Bosnia under the ECHO programme could have disappeared.
In the interview, Anita Gradin stated that she stood by the decisions taken in the Commission.
Among the principal tasks of the present Commission is to shed light on the events that took place under the previous Commission and to make changes to prevent any recurrence.
Public openness is a major factor in that process.
In what way does the Commission consider that the letter to Anita Gradin contributes towards greater openness and greater public confidence in the Commission?
Question No 52 by (H-0122/01):
Subject: The Commission's actions regarding criticisms by a former Member of the Commission What is known as the ECHO scandal of 1997, when irregularities resulted in the disappearance of huge amounts of EU aid and documents relating to the case later disappeared from the Commission's archives, has been the focus of much attention in Sweden and Denmark.
On TV programmes in both countries, former Commissioner Anita Gradin and her former chef de cabinet have voiced criticism of the Commission's handling of the affair.
In response to the comments they made, Commissioner Kinnock wrote to both of them arguing that they had no right to criticise the Commission as an institution.
If, contrary to expectation, there is a rule which says that they do not have a right to criticise, it would represent a dramatic step backwards for free speech in the European Union.
On what legal grounds does the Commission argue that a former Member of the Commission and her former chef de cabinet do not have a right to voice such criticism of the Commission?
Mr President, I am very grateful to the honourable Members for their questions about my correspondence with my friend and former colleague, Mrs Anita Gradin, and her former chef de cabinet, Mr Christer Asp.
The questions enable me to report publicly and fully to this House on an issue that I know has aroused interest particularly in Sweden.
On 13 November 2000 Danish TV broadcast a documentary programme in which statements were attributed to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp that appeared to relate to an employee of the Commission who had been unanimously acquitted of specific charges by the last Commission after due disciplinary process had been followed.
As a result of that broadcast, and as Commissioner responsible for Personnel and Administration, I was obliged to write to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp on 22 November to request confirmation and clarification of the reported remarks, in order to enable the Commission to establish whether or not the remarks in question would require any action by the Commission.
That was the sole purpose of the letter.
It did not, either in tone or in content, demand explanations, offer criticism, seek to gag anyone or imply in any way that either Mrs Gradin, as a former Commissioner, or Mr Asp, as a former official, had no right to criticise the Commission as an institution.
In order to make that absolutely clear, I will readily provide copies of that letter and all other relevant correspondence to the honourable Members as soon as I have confirmation from Mrs Gradin that she has no objection to that course of action.
Mrs Gradin has indicated by an indirect route that she would be agreeable to such a release of correspondence but naturally, as a matter of courtesy to her, I prefer to have direct confirmation of her agreement.
Mrs Gradin replied to my 22 November letter on 29 December and I wrote a further letter to her on 25 January 2001.
As I pointed out in that letter to Mrs Gradin, and as the House will be aware, the Staff Regulations applicable to all EU institutions make it clear that the Commission as an institution and as an employer is legally liable to assist employees in defending themselves against attack.
That obligation also means defending an acquitted person against any questioning of their innocence of the charges on which they were acquitted.
My 22 November letters to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp therefore related entirely to such legal obligations and considerations and to absolutely nothing else.
As I made clear in my letter of 25 January to Mrs Gradin, whilst all liberties of speech are precious and must be upheld, the expression of certain opinions - for instance those that may be considered to defame others - can have legal consequences in all democratic societies, and have specific implications for the Commission as an employing European institution.
In that letter I also made clear beyond doubt that my letter of 22 November was not in any way an attempt to limit free comment or to prevent criticism of the Commission either by Mrs Gradin, or indeed by Mr Asp or anyone else.
All this will be evident to honourable Members when they have the chance to read the exchange of correspondence, as I hope they will. That will also enable them to see that the basis for consideration of the actions of former commissioners and former officials is the Treaty and the Staff Regulations.
Mrs Gradin has obviously always taken her duty of discretion provided for in the Treaty seriously as a responsible and reputable person.
I am sure that will continue.
Well, that really takes the biscuit!
That is probably one of the most ridiculously evasive answers I have heard in a very long time.
Mr Kinnock says that we would have known what the letter contained if we had been able to study it. Marvellous, if we only get to see it after the debate!
I applied to Mr Kinnock' s office so as to be able to study the letter before the debate, but I was told that I could possibly get to examine it after the debate.
That only goes to show that Mr Kinnock has not understood in the slightest what openness really means.
Mr Kinnock appears not to have learned anything from the scandal involving the Commission to which he previously belonged - the Santer Commission, which fell because it did not understand the link between transparency, on the one hand, and corruption and fraud, on the other.
If Mr Kinnock had learned anything from the Commission to which he then belonged, he would have understood.
I refer to the type of threatening letter which he obviously wrote and which Mrs Gradin understood as such, to judge from the statements she made to the Swedish press.
Mrs Gradin must surely have read the letter before she made her statement.
In the same way, Mr Asp must surely have read the letter before he made his statement.
They no doubt knew, in any case, what the letter contained, and they obviously perceived it as a threat.
It does in fact dishonour Parliament and is an insult to this House to turn tail and evade responsibility, as Mr Kinnock is now doing.
I would ask Members to take account of the fact that they are allowed to ask supplementary questions.
This is not an opportunity for you to give a lesson to the Commissioner in the reply, but of asking the questions which you consider to be appropriate.
I have no way of knowing previously whether you are going to ask a question, but I would ask you to obey the Rules of Procedure.
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer and should like to ask a question: where does Commissioner Kinnock believe that criticism ought to be directed?
Should it be directed at the fact that some millions of euros which should have gone in aid have disappeared and that taxpayers' money has been mismanaged; or should it be directed against those who express their disappointment at the fact that these issues have not been successfully clarified?
I think the answer should be simple, and I believe that the people of Europe also think the answer is obvious.
My second question concerns the fact that, if the Commission wrote a letter to former Commissioner Gradin, it must have believed that she had in some way attacked an individual.
I myself saw the TV programme and I am able to say that she did not do so.
She was completely loyal to the decisions taken in the Commission. How could you believe that former Commissioner Gradin had directed criticism against individuals?
You must obviously have thought she had done so, because you wrote the letter.
Thank you for your answer.
Mr Kinnock refers to the letter to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp.
We have not of course read it directly, but a copy of the letter to Mr Asp - which I assume has been correctly reproduced - has now been published in the Swedish media which, after referring to the television programme, state that Mr Kinnock wrote in the following terms to Mr Asp: "As you perhaps know, this statement has, fairly or unfairly, been interpreted as criticism of the Commission as an institution.
Because you were formerly employed at the Commission, your statement raises the question of what kind of obligations you have because, as an employee, you have to comply with various terms of employment and Staff Regulations" .
Clearly, this can hardly be interpreted as anything other than an insinuation that Mr Asp did something he ought not to have done and that he might perhaps even deserve a reprimand.
My question, therefore, is as follows: what legal basis is there for this letter?
What kind of legal regulations are there to say that former chefs de cabinet or Commissioners do not have the right to criticise the Commission as an institution, and on what legal basis are such people even to be reminded of Staff Regulations and their various terms of employment?
Mr President, I would like first of all to say to Mr Färm by that if he examines the Staff Regulations to which Mr Asp is subject, then he will see the basis on which he was written to by his former employing authority and he will see that what was said in that letter was entirely in keeping with the regulations and the requirements of communication - no more, no less.
Mr Andersson may have his own view about the case that was referred to in the TV documentary.
That is not what this question is about and it is not what my letter to Mrs Gradin was about, but he is a democrat and he will understand.
In Sweden, as in any other Member State, or democratic society, caution must be exercised in making a declaration about anyone who has been acquitted of a particular charge that could imply defamation of that person.
That is a general rule that is understood and upheld by democrats everywhere, but in the case of the Commission as an employing institution, as I pointed out earlier, there is an additional implication that if a Commission official is attacked and if it is a Commission official in a specific case who has been acquitted under due process of a charge, than that official can make claims upon the Commission and therefore on taxpayers' money under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations in order to fight that case of alleged defamation.
The point that I made to Mrs Gradin, which I am sure she completely understands - especially since I explained in full in my most recent letter, simply relates to that legal reality and the proper discharge of the functions of the Commission as a legally constituted organisation with obligations set down in law in the form of the Staff Regulations.
Mr Andersson may have his own views about the particular cases referred to in the TV documentary.
He is entitled to those views whether they are right, wrong, substantiated or otherwise, but he will understand, I am certain, that all the actions taken in relation to people named in that television documentary, and one in particular, relate to the legal questions - as I emphasised in my letter to Mrs Gradin and in my earlier reply - and not to wider judgments which may be a matter entirely for Mr Andersson's view and his own conscience.
I will not say or do anything at any point which could result in unfair and unjustified charges on the Commission, the European Union and on the taxpayers' money, when there are other means of ensuring that the law is upheld so far as individuals are concerned.
I say to Mr Gahrton that the problem is not one of transparency in this case, it is of the deficiencies either of his hearing or his understanding.
What I said was not ridiculous.
I will send him a copy of my reply and when I have the agreement of Mrs Gradin for the release of the letters that we exchanged, including my personal letter to her of 25 January, written in an official capacity, he can see it.
But I am sure that he will understand, as someone who observes the courtesies and recognises the basis on which a personal letter is written, that it is not for me to release a letter which I wrote to Mrs Gradin.
If Mrs Gradin wants to release it or gives me permission to release it, that is absolutely fine with me and, as I said, she has indicated by an indirect route that she would be agreeable to that.
I am not surprised at that - I know Anita Gradin very well - but until I have formal confirmation I cannot release the letter.
It is not in any way a secret.
I simply hope that Mr Gahrton's powers of comprehension will advance greatly by the time that he reads the letter because he did not show much evidence in the course of his contribution of having any more than the most rudimentary understanding.
I have a supplementary question concerning the Commission' s Information Office in Stockholm and its former head, Linda Steneberg.
As the Commissioner must know, a criminal investigation is under way concerning financial irregularities at the Commission' s Office in Stockholm.
The Swedish police have begun questioning a number of the employees and wish to question Mrs Steneberg, who has now been promoted and works for the Commission in Brussels.
Mrs Steneberg is refusing to cooperate with the Swedish police and to travel to Stockholm for questioning.
Is it not reasonable for you, as the people with responsibility, to call upon your employees, or even order them, to appear for questioning so that financial crime that has taken place within the Commission' s area of responsibility might be investigated?
This question has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the question on the order paper.
I will, however, respond to it in the interests of transparency.
The person named by the honourable Member, who is a Commission official, has indicated total readiness to respond to all enquiries from the Swedish prosecutor.
That will take place in due course.
Question No 53 by (H-0083/01):
Subject: Candidates for Director-General posts The Commission's memorandum on 'Targets for the Recruitment and Appointment of Women 2000' states that the proportion of women in A1 and A2 posts is to increase by 20% by 2005.
According to the latest information in my possession, there are still only 3 women among the Commission's 49 Directors-General.
It is, therefore, surprising that the Commission has again appointed a man as Director-General for aid and development despite the fact that there was a very well qualified female candidate.
The selection board consisted of 8 men.
How is equality of opportunity safeguarded in the appointment of the Commission's Directors-General?
The Commission is very conscious of the need to increase the proportion of women in A1 and A2 grades.
It is for that reason that, since 1995, annual targets are set for the appointment of women to these and to other management posts.
The Commission's overall target, as announced at the beginning of our term of office in 1999, is to double the number of women in these two grades during its term in office, thereby raising the number of women in A1 and A2 posts to 44 or about 20% by 2005.
To achieve this, the annual targets are set on the basis of anticipated turnover in the grades each year.
In 2000 the target for the appointment of women to A1 was two appointments and the target for A2 was five appointments.
These targets were exceeded with three new appointments being made to the A1 grade and seven new appointments to the A2 grade.
As a result, the current number of women at A1 level is four out of 54 and the number of women at A2 level is 21 out of 178.
The Commission intends to continue its practice of setting annual targets because it has evidently assisted improvement in the gender balance, although patently not enough.
The Commission will adopt the annual target for 2001 next month.
In addition to the policy of target setting, the members of selection boards are reminded of the principles of equal opportunities to be taken into consideration in the selection of candidates.
The Commission seeks to appoint the most suitable candidate for a post and, where there are equal merits relating to the relevant post, to give priority to the female candidate.
The outcome must arise from objective assessment by the appropriate authority of each individual situation and is not therefore automatic for persons of either gender.
In the case referred to by the honourable Member, the advisory committee on appointments shortlisted a female candidate with good qualifications.
The Commission considered that the candidate chosen had a profile more particularly related to the tasks of the post in question.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Unfortunately, we women come up against a glass ceiling within the EU' s institutions, too.
I am grateful for, and pleased with, the action plan with practical objectives you have taken as your starting point, but a timetable also needs to be established.
It is extremely gratifying that you should want to work to end discrimination but, since the Commission has now once again appointed a man to the post of Director-General - this time as the Development Directorate-General - I wonder if the Commission' s objectives were just so much rhetoric.
The eight men on the selection board had to choose between a woman with wide political and administrative experience at a high level and solid experience abroad, and a man with no political background, less administrative experience and no experience abroad.
I can only draw the conclusion that the male candidate was appointed on a quota basis.
In Sweden, successful appeals are made to the Labour Market Court in cases involving considerably less flagrant discrimination than this one.
Is the Commission prepared to tear up its decision and give this post to the most competent candidate, or must an appeal be made to the European Court of Justice in this case?
Is the Commission prepared in future to have at least 50 per cent women on its selection boards and not 100 per cent men?
As the honourable Member underlines, the system that we are seeking to develop in the European Commission does not yet bear any comparison with arrangements that have existed in Sweden, and indeed in some other Member States, for some years.
We can do nothing more in the circumstances than continue to strive to meet the best standards which we heartily recommend to others throughout the European Union.
These are standards which I, and my colleagues in the current Commission, sincerely want to meet.
If I could respond to the specific issues raised by the honourable Member: there is not enough representation of women at any level, including the managerial ranks, in any of the European Union institutions.
We are, as the honourable Member was good enough to acknowledge, making a serious effort to improve upon that in the European Commission.
But in the European Parliament, for instance, I think I am right in saying that out of the ten directors only one is a woman.
The position in the Council, if anything, is not even as good as that.
So in each of the institutions, including the others like the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors, there is patently need for very substantial improvement and I am very happy to have the opportunity at this Question Time in Parliament to underline that very forcibly yet again.
I believe we will reach the targets by 2005.
They are not over-ambitious targets.
Indeed, several of us would argue in the current Commission that they are over-modest.
They are however realistic given our starting point.
What we hope will be the case is that by securing that at least 20% of senior management jobs are in the hands of women by the end of this Commission, it will provide the incoming Commission with a much firmer and higher base from which to work towards genuine gender balance across the Commission, particularly in managerial roles.
I take the point that the honourable Member made about the single-sex nature of the selection board.
It is not in fact a selection board.
It is an advisory committee on appointments.
The final selection of candidates is made by the portfolio Commissioner, by myself as the Commissioner for Personnel Administration, and the President.
The basis on which the selection was made, as I said earlier, involved no criticism of, or disrespect for, the high qualifications of the woman candidate who came before us; it related, as I said, to the fact that the candidate chosen had a profile more particularly suited to the tasks of the post in question.
No preference on gender grounds was shown towards a man.
Mr President, following on the discussion, would Mr Kinnock like to confirm to the House that career development based on performance and merit is going to be the foundation of the reforms that we approved in this House last year?
Will he also take the opportunity to tell us what progress he is making in introducing structured performance appraisal throughout the Commission and in his moves towards a linear career structure.
Mr President, this question, as Mr Harbour will be aware, has direct relevance to the question raised by Mrs Theorin because we believe that amongst the many other justifications for making changes, as regards appraisal and the advance towards a more linear career structure, will be to give fairer treatment to women officials, and indeed to make the Commission more attractive for the employment of women, particularly women who have family obligations.
So far as progress is concerned, on 28 February 2001 the Commission will give consideration to a series of eight detailed draft proposals which will then be submitted for consultation to all the staff, and for formal negotiations to the staff representatives, as well as to two orientation papers, one of which relates to pay and pensions and the other to the more linear career system.
We are therefore at the point - on the linear career system, on systematic appraisal and on a host of complementary activities - of making formal proposals, and of beginning detailed consultations on them.
This is with a view, by the summer break, to compiling finalised proposals either for Commission decisions - which have the force of law - or proposals to this House and the Council where amendments to the Staff Regulations are required.
The support and interest of this House is invaluable in all of these reform activities, both those relating to improvement in the gender balance and, much more widely, those seeking to ensure improvements in the efficiency of Commission staff and in professional support for them.
I hope that this support and understanding will continue.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would be interested to know whether the country of origin is in fact also a criterion applied in selecting women.
Mr President, the Commission seeks to fulfil its obligations to maintain a reasonable gender balance, not only in managerial roles but right throughout the staff of the Commission.
The reason we do this is because this is a unique multinational and multilingual Union, and it is essential that the executive administration of the Union reflects the diversity of cultures and languages in the staffing of the Commission.
The same applies to trying to secure a much improved gender balance.
I can honestly say to the honourable gentleman that no preference is given on the basis of the sex of a person or the flag that they happen to be born under or the passport that they carry.
Consequently we will strive to maximise the premium allocated to merit, whilst trying at the same time, by a variety of practical means, to maintain an improved gender balance and also to sustain a regional geographical balance as befits our multinational organisation.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Question No 54 by (H-0011/01):
Subject: Decisions concerning BSE Will the Commission describe the position in the various Member States following the December 2000 decisions on action against BSE?
How have the decisions been implemented in the individual countries and how is the Commission verifying proper compliance with them?
What monitoring facilities have been set up?
How is the Commission verifying that animal or bonemeal is not present in feedingstuffs in the individual Member States?
Have all Member States got adequate residual capacity and full registration of livestock so that any infection can be traced?
How many animals have accumulated in the individual countries?
How much offal has accumulated for destruction and how is it being stored?
The Commission has recently received information from the Member States on their implementation of BSE control measures, and in particular on the new measures on animal feed and the testing of animals for BSE.
The information was provided in response to a questionnaire sent to Member States on 5 January 2001.
This questionnaire has enabled the Commission to obtain a reasonably complete picture of the way in which the measures are being implemented, and this seems broadly satisfactory.
A working document which summarises the responses of the Member States to this questionnaire was also circulated for discussion at the Agriculture Council on 29 January.
Member States are responsible for the implementation of these measures.
In the case of the feed ban, implementation includes regular microscopic examination of feedstuffs and inspection of feedstuff plants.
This in turn is audited by the personnel of the Food and Veterinary Office who have already visited a number of the Member States to this end since December 2000, and intend to visit the rest early in 2001.
The reports on these inspection visits will be made available to Parliament and published on the Internet in the usual manner.
Legislation on the identification and registration of bovine animals specifies that each Member State must set up a national database for bovine animals and that the computerised databases should become fully operational no later than 31 December 1999.
The fully operational character of the national databases for bovine animals has been verified by the Commission for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom as regards Northern Ireland.
Portugal, France and Germany have requested the recognition of the fully operational character of their national databases and the Commission is in the process of studying these requests.
The Commission does not have exact figures for the amount of processed animal protein that has accumulated in Member States.
It is aware that the disposal of this material poses a problem for some Member States and that those States are actively seeking a solution.
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
I am very glad that we are to be told the result of the questionnaire at the next meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I nonetheless sense from your answer that there is a very big difference between the status of the individual Member States, as we knew there was before 1 December.
Only a very short time has, of course, elapsed.
In view of the health situation, a particularly long period ought not to be allowed to elapse, out of consideration for both consumers and farmers.
This is also because, right now, there is distortion of competition between farmers in the individual Member States, because the compensation offered is very different from one country to another.
I hope it will not be the slowest, but the fastest, countries which set the pace, for I am completely convinced that it is in that way that we shall achieve a result in which all the current 15 EU countries have implemented these BSE decisions.
I am very concerned to ensure that we have Community measures in relation to all of these issues and that all Member States apply the Community law in the same way.
This was not necessarily the case earlier last year and towards the end of last year, but I see some signs that it might be achieved following the Community measures that have now been brought forward.
I have every hope that any differences that arise in Member States will soon be a thing of the past.
Question No 55 by (H-0019/01):
Subject: BSE What follow-up measures have been taken by the Commission and in the Member States in respect of Parliament's 1997 report on BSE? What measures is the Commission taking to ensure compliance with the Community legislation in force on prevention of this disease in the Member States?
The Commission replied in its final consolidated report to Parliament's report on BSE of 1997 by setting an ambitious work programme.
In two more biannual follow-up reports to Parliament it gave a broad overview of the emergency measures taken to combat BSE, to increase the safety of animal feed and to implement the new approach in the fields of scientific advice, risk analysis and inspection.
The Commission services have since been restructured to assure the independence and transparency of the scientific committees, the reinforcement of the inspectorate and the separation of consumer protection from the markets.
A solid body of legislative measures has been introduced on which the Commission has regularly reported to Parliament.
These measures include, for example, the requirement to remove and destroy specified risk materials, to pressure-cook animal waste and to actively survey the animal populations for the presence of TSEs.
The Commission has also made use of the new legal provision of the Treaty of Amsterdam to propose regulations under the codecision procedure on the prevention and control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and on the processing of animal by-products.
These regulations will bring together in a single substantive legal text a wide range of measures which are currently based on safeguard provisions of Community veterinary legislation.
If the negotiations run their course as expected, the regulation on TSEs should be adopted next month.
The proposed regulation on animal by-products is expected to be voted on by Parliament shortly.
In the meantime, the Commission continues to monitor the situation on the spot, requesting scientific advice and taking legal measures whenever needed.
The evidence resulting from the very regular visits of the Food and Veterinary Office and the scientific opinions of the Scientific Steering Committee has become the basis for the consumer protection policy of the Commission.
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his reply and I take note of the fact that, from a legislative point of view, the Commission has made considerable progress since 1997.
I would like to ask a supplementary question, as a result of the perplexity expressed by my constituents at the horrendous errors and contradictions of the Spanish authorities.
Specifically, a regional Agricultural Minister has ordered that dead cows be deposited in an open mine.
There have been statements from one minister saying one thing while another minister says the opposite.
At least in Germany ministers have resigned.
My question is: apart from legislative measures, does the Commission intend to take executive measures in relation to the Member States?
Will the Commission exercise a greater presence in our States in order to offer the citizens guarantees?
Has the Commission at any point considered employing infringement proceedings, by means of a letter of infringement, so that the Community citizens may realise that the Commission it truly fighting for their safety and health?
The implementation by Member States of safety measures put in place at Community level is of crucial importance.
There is little point in passing legislation at Community level if it is not fully and rigorously implemented by the Member States.
There are a number of responses available to the Commission in the event that there is a persistent failure by any Member State to properly implement these safety laws.
These are, for instance, the initiation of infringement proceedings against that Member State or, alternatively, by taking Community measures which can be understood to mean the putting in place of safety provisions which would prevent the Member State in question from exporting its product.
In this instance I assume that when you are talking about these issues you are talking about beef.
These are obviously very powerful measures.
They are required to be brought into effect in circumstances where there is a failure by Member States to implement the safety provisions.
It is appropriate to bring these measures into place, however, only in circumstances where the breach has been persistent.
There has to be a pattern of behaviour by a Member State of ignoring the law.
One or two incidents would not trigger the infringement proceedings nor require the taking of Community measures.
This is an issue which is kept constantly under review by my services and myself to ensure that there is full compliance and to ensure that the consumers are properly and fully protected, both by the laws and the implementation of the laws.
Mr President, I am not going to spend or waste part of my time responding to or criticising any of the Member States who are or are not complying with the legislation, but I would like to ask the Commissioner a series of specific question on the issue of harmonisation.
If the Member States are required, and I am in agreement with this, Commissioner, to comply with the rules that are dictated from here, those rules need to be clear and the same for everybody.
What level of compliance can be demanded when we are talking about applying tests?
A period of 30 months is imposed on the Member States and they agree to it, but there are, however, some Member States that already apply a period of 24 months.
What guarantees are being offered to consumers?
Do you not think that this issue causes considerable alarm and insecurity among consumers?
The same could be said about the issue of removing the vertebral column, on the subject of risk materials. There is only talk of removing the vertebral column for two Member States and for animals of more than 30 months.
There are exceptions for some Member States, but what are they?
And what is the reason for them? Why, on 7 February of this year, did the Standing Veterinary Committee carry out the evaluation for removing the vertebral column from animals of more than 12 months?
Where is the harmonisation?
It is very difficult, Commissioner, for safety assurances to be given to consumers with regard to beef when there is legislative dysfunction.
It is important to understand what we are talking about.
I understand that the honourable Member is asking me about the measure that was introduced last week at the SVC for the removal of the vertebral column as distinct from the spinal cord.
The spinal cord has been designated as a specified risk material (SRM) for a long time and has been removed in many Member States as such for a long time; it has been removed now as a matter of law in the European Union by all Member States since 1 October 2000.
If you are referring to the vertebral column, I will deal with that aspect of your question by saying that the proposal that I put before SVC for their decision last week was firmly based on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee.
The situation is that something over 95% of the infectivity is located in the SRM in an infected animal.
The removal of the vertebral column is regarded by the scientists to account for an additional couple of percentage points so that, in the context of the whole question of the removal of specific risk material, this is an ultra-precautionary measure.
In advising whether this should be done, the Scientific Steering Committee examined the available evidence from Member States and came to the conclusion that it was appropriate to remove the vertebral column in circumstances where Member States did not have a substantially BSE-free regime or did not have control measures in place which would be equivalent to very low BSE-incidence.
Bearing in mind that advice, a conclusion was reached that it was appropriate to grant waivers to the five Member States that you are referring to, two of them because they had very rigorous control measures in place, and the other three because they were in category 2 of the geographical risk assessment that was published last July, thereby identifying those Member States as being at very low risk.
Accordingly, the waivers were granted in those circumstances.
It is a Community-wide measure.
It applies to all Member States.
However, in circumstances where it is appropriate, in the individual circumstances of an individual Member State, and strictly on the advice of scientists who advise me, it was considered appropriate to allow for derogations.
Not only did the Scientific Steering Committee give advice on which that decision was based, but the Standing Veterinary Committee came to the same conclusion, as did the Commission.
This was a justifiable response.
There are many Member States which take the view that I went too far.
There are Member States that take the view that I did not go far enough.
Proportionate responses in these circumstances are what we tried to achieve.
With regard to the 24 months, I assume that you are referring to the fact that there is a requirement to test animals above the age of 30 months.
There is one Member State that has reduced that on its own territory to 24 months, but that has absolutely no trade implications between that State and other Member States; that Member State has presumably concluded that it would be worthwhile reducing it to 24 months having regard to the age profile of a couple of positives that they have found.
I substantially agree with the basis of your question, which is that it is better to have Community measures right across the board rather than have individual measures, but sometimes individual Member States or a particular measure that is somewhat different from the Community measure can be justified in circumstances where a particularly unique situation is obtained in a Member State.
Question No 56 by (H-0021/01):
Subject: BSE and consumption of cattle bones The Spanish Minister for Health recently aroused concern among consumers in Spain when she advised 'housewives' not to buy 'cheap meat' and not to use cattle bones when making stock.
Does the Commission consider that any link exists between the price of meat on the market and consumer guarantees?
Does the Commission believe that cattle bones present risks and have to be banned?
Is their sale outlawed in any Member State?
If so, does the ban operate across the board, or does it affect only a particular type of bone?
Community hygiene legislation applies to all meat or meat products irrespective of their price, ensuring the same high level of consumer protection.
It is not acceptable that cheap meat should be less safe than dearer meat.
The Commission is very carefully following all issues relating to material which could present risks as regards transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
In this context, it gave a prominent mandate to the Scientific Steering Committee to review the current list of so-called specified risk material if new scientific evidence becomes available in this field.
In June 2000 the Commission adopted Decision 2000/418/EC which requires the removal of a series of bovine, ovine and caprine tissues from food and feed chains.
In particular it provides that bones of the skull from cattle over 12 months of age have to be banned in all Member States.
In addition, it extends the list of specified risk material to the vertebral column of bovine animals over 30 months of age in the United Kingdom and Portugal.
Following further opinions of the Scientific Steering Committee, the Commission presented a proposal at the Standing Veterinary Committee meeting of 7 February, which designated the vertebral column as a specified risk material to be removed and destroyed for cattle over the age of 12 months.
This proposal was accepted by the Standing Veterinary Committee and, when it is formally adopted, Member States will be required to ensure removal of the vertebral column.
This may take place at the point of sale, that is in the butchers' shops, from 31 March 2001.
The proposal included provisions for derogations from the obligation to remove the vertebral column, on the basis of scientific committee opinions, for five Member States - Austria, Finland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
This derogation is conditional on continued and improved surveillance for the presence of BSE in those Member States, with increased testing of certain categories of animals required.
The derogations will be reviewed if necessary in the light of the results of these tests and further scientific advice.
Mr President, I think that Mrs Redondo expressed it very well in her speech and that, indeed, in this BSE crisis there are Member States who are advantaged pupils, who prepare for the examinations months in advance, and others, such as ours, the government of my country, who are at the bottom of the class, prepare for the examinations five minutes before and when they fail, blame the teacher.
And this teacher is you, Commissioner.
The Spanish Government became aware of the first case of BSE in October, although it kept it a secret until December.
The lack of transparency and the improvisation with which my country' s government is acting with regard to the crisis are, in my opinion, the reason for the massive drop in consumption in Spain, for which the cattle farming sector is paying. This is especially the case for my region, Galicia, where cows are an element of social cohesion and, more importantly, are - as a well-known and admired writer says - a totem.
I therefore ask you: can the Commissioner give assurances to consumers that in Spain the measures adopted by the European Union are now being fully complied with?
Are there any future measures for which we should be preparing ourselves?
As I said in response to an earlier question, I firmly believe that the implementation of the safety measures is of critical importance and that this implementation must be rigorously applied in all Member States.
I have written to Member States, I am regularly in contact with Member States, I discuss this issue in the Agriculture Council quite regularly, and the importance of the implementation of laws is something that the Ministers for Agriculture and the governments in Member States are fully aware of.
I agree with you in the event that there is a failure in the implementation of the laws which we have put into place, that this can result in a falling-off in consumer confidence.
If consumers feel that the laws that have been put in place for their benefit are not fully implemented, then they see themselves as being at risk.
I believe that all Member States now fully understand the importance of this.
There may have been some laxity in some Member States in the past but I am quite convinced now, from my observation of the situation and from hearing the observations of, in particular, Ministers for Agriculture and Health in the various Councils, that there is a full and complete appreciation of the need to fully implement the legislation.
There are renewed efforts in all Member States to achieve this for the benefit of consumer health.
Commissioner, are you aware of, and do you agree with, the fact that in Spain the Guardia Civil is the new authority responsible for ensuring food safety for European citizens, that it is responsible for ensuring food safety with regard to BSE?
Are you aware that the Guardia Civil does not reveal the identity of some of those arrested for meat meal fraud?
Do you agree with this?
Are you aware that this afternoon Mr Fischler said to us in this House that it is not necessary to sacrifice all the animals on a farm where only one case has been declared?
And are you aware that the Spanish Minister for Agriculture - they do not allow the Minister for Health to talk - is saying that we absolutely have to slaughter all the animals?
Is this not a contradiction?
Are you aware that what citizens are receiving is this contradictory and chaotic information?
What do you say about the issue of the Guardia Civil?
Answer me please.
Mr President, I imagine that the involvement of the Guardia Civil in these circumstances probably relates to what you identified yourself: in circumstances where there is a failure to comply with the law by some meat plant or somebody else who has a responsibility to handle meat, a criminal offence may very well have taken place and in such circumstances it is probably appropriate that there is a criminal investigation.
The specifics of the involvement of the Guardia Civil in this particular issue is something that I have not got any detailed information on but I assume that the involvement is in the way that I have identified.
In response to your question about the culling of animals in circumstances where there is a positive finding relating to a herd, at present it is a decision for the Member State involved to determine whether it is appropriate to cull the entire herd or not.
It is a matter for the Member State to decide.
Some Member States do that.
Other Member States choose to kill all cohorts which is obviously a different defence or protection measure and there are those who take the view that it is at least as good and may even be better.
As I stated, it is a matter for each Member State to decide how to respond in these circumstances.
I also wish to draw your attention to the fact that the TSE regulation is now passing through the legislative process, as I mentioned in answer to an earlier question.
That regulation provides for the culling of the herd and the killing of cohorts and it also provides for other measures that a Member State notifies to the Commission which the Commission, through its scientific advisers, is satisfied provides at least the same degree of protection for consumer health.
That other measure can be allowed in those circumstances.
In reply to your question on the culling of the entire herd, that is a matter entirely within the competence of the Member State to decide.
Mr President, can I ask the Commissioner specifically: are bones for soup stock other than the vertebrae and skull perfectly safe and all right to use?
Is osso buco, which I think is made from the shank of cattle, all right to eat and is oxtail, which is actually I suppose an extension of the vertebrae, all right to eat?
As I indicated in the earlier part of my answer, the bones that are identified as being required to be removed are those that are specified risk material.
Any other material from an animal which does not fall within the definition of specified risk material is fit for human consumption.
Mr Carnero González has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I will try to be precise and quick in expressing my surprise that 8 questions, from various Members, on the same subject, the Western Sahara, have been included on the agenda in the third block of this sitting, and it is therefore impossible for the Commission to answer.
I would like the President of Parliament to explain what criteria are used to make such decisions, because, quite simply, I find them very hard to understand.
Mr Carnero, when Question Time began, I pointed out the criteria, which are in the Rules of Procedure and the directives annexed to the Rules of Procedure and in the letters that the President of Parliament - not of the sitting - sends to Members.
The problem is then of exactly defining the criteria.
In any case, I am certainly taking note of this matter, which I will of course pass on to the President of Parliament.
As the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 59 to 118 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Deliberate release of GMOs into the environment
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Bowe on the report and on the positions assumed which, given the thorny nature of the issue of genetically modified organisms, is genuinely well-balanced.
What is the conclusion?
The conclusion is that rules and monitoring are necessary.
I am sure that we will be able to find some point of contention - for example, the issues of traceability and labelling remain unresolved - but given the crucial need for regulation, I feel that this task has been more than adequately performed.
It must also be remembered that there are many things at stake in this complex matter of genetically modified organisms: it could even be said that, from many points of view, the role of the European Union itself is at stake with regard to many of its forthcoming commitments, such as the World Trade Organisation reforms, the research programme we are about to launch, the development and employment programmes, the relations which will ensue from the creation of new markets, and the globalisation processes which will lead to the redefinition of economic processes.
So, as far as GMOs are concerned, we must not forget that the situations in many different countries are different.
I would mention, at random, China, South Africa and Mexico, which already grow genetically modified organisms, and other countries such as Cuba which we know are preparing to do so; then there are other countries again, such as Nigeria, Thailand and the Philippines, which are extremely interested in the potential offered by biotechnologies.
So the question is this: what role does the Union intend to play in a future which has already become present reality?
I feel that the answer which is most relevant to the European Parliament's role can only be to set a course and establish a strategy which reflect a position of total involvement.
This does not mean either accepting or rejecting, and still less bringing forward or extending the time frames.
Above all, it means giving a sort of green light to all studies, applications or patents relating to biotechnologies.
The Bowe report has more than succeeded in achieving this result.
Mr President, the result of the conciliation that we have before us is a substantial improvement upon the rules for the release of GMOs into the environment.
We are to obtain more stringent risk assessment requirements.
The long-term effects of the many authorisations are also to be looked into.
We are to have better monitoring, and we are to see time limits placed upon individual authorisations.
I think that all this together will make an important contribution to the protection of the environment and the protection of public health.
However, I have a couple of questions for the Commission about a number of matters I think it is important to have clarified today, for there are, of course, still a number of deficiencies in this area.
Firstly, I would ask the Commission to give an assurance today that, whenever we devise vertical legislation in different areas concerned with GMO crops, we also make sure that this vertical legislation respects the general directive we are now adopting on releases into the environment.
My second question concerns labelling and traceability, for I really find it worrying that the Commission has not by now been in a position to submit a proposal on labelling.
On this matter too, however, I would ask that we be given a more detailed explanation of the letter sent by Commissioner Byrne and Commissioner Wallström to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and stating the desire to provide citizens with better information on GMOs.
I do not think that the word "better" is enough.
It is important for full information to be given and for there not, therefore, to be a system provided in which there are still a whole lot of gaps in the information given to consumers about GMOs.
We are not interested in buying a pig in a poke.
It is important that we obtain real consumer choice and that short measure is not given in this area. I therefore hope that we can obtain a statement on this issue today.
I could also do with an assurance from the Commission that, as has been mentioned, the way to new authorisations will not be opened until the new rules have come into force in 2002.
The desire to insert conditions corresponding to the new rules in any authorisations given before the law comes into force is, of course, very commendable. However, if the law has not come into force, then it will not, of course, be possible to enforce these rules if the authorised businesses contravene them.
I am therefore definitely of the view that one ought to respect the fact that the legislation must come into force before a start is made on issuing authorisations under the new rules.
That is the only way we can be sure that it will, in actual fact, also be possible to enforce the rules.
Mr President, rapporteur Bowe concluded that the conciliation procedure concerning the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms had a satisfactory outcome overall.
The Liberal Group would agree with this, although naturally there is still room for improvement, for example regarding the protection of biodiversity, but these are matters to be revisited at a later date.
The primary objective of the new directive is the safety of the environment and public health.
It follows logically from this that although it may be acceptable to use GMOs, there must always be systematic, independent and in-depth research prior to the release, into the potential risks to the environment and to public health.
What is important in this respect is that the directive introduces mandatory monitoring after the placing on the market of GMO products and a mandatory time limitation of maximum ten years for first-time consent.
This will enable us to encourage research into and use of GMOs on the one hand, whilst still being able to monitor the situation.
Comprehensive information promotes the consumer' s freedom of choice.
The consumer must be able to have absolute certainty as to whether a particular product does or does not contain GMOs.
The only way to do this is through labelling which is the very model of clarity.
So we are pleased to hear that the Commission is planning to produce proposals along these lines in the very near future.
Lastly, I am delighted that the Commission has pledged to bring forward proposals for supplementary liability provisions for the various types of environmental damage in all areas of the European Union, before the end of this year.
It is still extremely important to keep a close eye on all the risks of damage to the environment and public health, and to restrict them using all possible means.
Mr President, Commissioner, the matter before us today is to determine whether or not tomorrow' s vote will result in the lifting of the moratorium on authorisations for the cultivation and placing on the market of GMOs.
The answer is, quite clearly, no, it will not.
We must pursue the moratorium since the revised 90/220 Directive does not meet all the requirements that we stipulated at the beginning.
While there has been some improvement, amongst other things, in the biological monitoring of future affected areas, inasmuch as it is possible to actually identify such areas, this will, however, be at the discretion of the relevant authorities.
The final compromise does not respond to consumer concerns, since consumers would like to see guarantees of food safety and to see proper assessment of the risks of releasing GMOs into the environment being carried out.
The BSE crisis could have been avoided, had more courageous decisions been taken as soon as the first warning signs emerged.
We must not make the same mistake twice.
I hope that the Commission will shortly outline proposals to guarantee the complete traceability of GMOs and to establish a reliable labelling system for all GMO-derived products.
Only then will we be able to authorise the release of GMOs into the environment.
Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Bowe, was right when he said this afternoon that not only his work but also the work of Parliament has moved this directive forward a great deal in terms of standards and restrictive use.
However, I would like to point out the concerns that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Parliament had at first and second reading.
I do not think that we can talk about all of them now, in the time that we have, but I will mention the use of antibiotic-resistant marker genes, the need to respect the Cartagena commitment (the international agreement), the civil responsibility clause, preventing this cultivation from being extended to other plants, the public register of plantations and the localisation of genetically modified organisms and the very serious subject of exports with initial consent and agreement.
Some of these concerns were taken up during the conciliation procedure, but there are others that are still a commitment and some others that may require long periods of time, for example the disappearance of the use of antibiotic-resistant marker genes.
In our opinion there are currently public health problems related to resistance to antibiotics, and there are infections that used to be cured with common antibiotics which cannot now be cured, not only naturally, but due to genetically modified products, due to the presence of other antibiotics, for example in livestock.
However, the time-scales are long and the problem is already there.
We think that there are other promises, which are only promises, that can be fulfilled, that perhaps the Commission is fulfilling, but we think that the moratorium should continue until all of this legislation is in force, Mr President.
I will finish by saying that this afternoon there was a speech from Mr Fischler in which he spoke about the economic catastrophe that BSE represents for Europe.
Let us not fall into this error again, that is, let us not take measures in a hurry, taking into account economic interests, if this carries risks for food safety and could later be an economic catastrophe as well as a food catastrophe.
Mr President, over the last few years we have seen a completely new development: the conversion of pharmaceutical companies into biotechnology companies, an explosion in the number of companies specialising in the development of genetically modified organisms, a steady increase in the allocation of public and private funds to support research in the field of genetics, the legal race to patent GMO seeds and even to patent the manipulation of the human genome, the truly astonishing speed of mergers and break-ups between biotech companies and even the emergence of new political frontiers and a new debate on ethics, agriculture, public health, the environment, hunger and poverty.
In short, biotechnology is bringing about a real revolution in science, economics and politics.
A revolution that brings hope but which also involves risks.
Therefore, the 'yes, because I say so' or 'no, because I say so' forms of fundamentalism will get us nowhere.
The answer lies in a fair balance between the freedom to conduct research and the need to protect public health and the environment.
I feel that this revision of the directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms respects this balance because, on the one hand, it does not impose restrictions on research or experiments and on the other, it lays down clearer and more restrictive rules on the release of GMOs into the environment, thereby protecting consumers and biodiversity.
Nevertheless, the revision of this directive will only be complete when the Commission goes ahead with legislative initiatives that implement, in a way that leaves no room for doubt, the principles that are now being declared on imposing responsibility for the environment and for the labelling and traceability of products containing GMOs.
Mr President, we have already talked a great deal about genetic modification here in Parliament.
Some of us believe that biotechnology has a glorious future ahead, whilst others are sceptical and point to the dangers, the risks and the scientific uncertainty.
Parliament has three tasks when it comes to the issues surrounding GMOs, the first being to create a vision.
A vision that points the way and is broadly based.
That is precisely what Parliament has had such a struggle with.
The parliamentary majority swings back and forth between the position of NGOs and that of the business community.
Given the polarisation of opinion, sound admission procedures are a must, i.e. procedures that guarantee safety, afford the consumer and the environment protection and uphold the precautionary principle.
The review of Directive 90/220 strikes a good balance, the best in the world in fact.
I think that we, together with the rapporteur, can be proud of the negotiated outcome.
Our second task is to take decisions and to foster decision making.
We must put an end to all the legal uncertainty within the industry.
A tricky situation has arisen within the industry in recent years.
There is a de facto moratorium but no decision has ever been taken to this effect.
We must make a breakthrough here, but this will only be possible if there are sufficient safeguards for consumers and if we can offer them legal certainty.
Consumers must have a choice and the Commission must provide guarantees to this effect.
Parliament' s third task is to take responsibility.
If we want to give the go-ahead, then we must also be prepared to take the responsibility that goes with it.
Why not give ourselves some encouragement by pointing out that the old situation was worse and that it will be possible for there to be a moratorium in the new situation.
But as I see it, we must also have the courage to say that with this directive, we have incorporated sufficient safeguards to give biotechnology a chance in Europe.
Each product must be examined in order to ascertain whether it satisfies requirements, but our responsibility goes further than that.
Parliament must continue to press for a form of monitoring of the social implications of biotechnology.
The assessment must not be restricted to matters of safety alone.
The usefulness to society of biotechnological inventions must form part of the assessment carried out by governments and the business community, so that we can go a step beyond the safety aspect.
This will benefit consumers all over the world, as well as industry.
Mr President, I would point out a paradox: the transgenic plant multinationals say that they are already ready to replace antibiotic-resistant marker genes with alternatives, but if that is so, why are they asking to be able to continue to use these markers until 2004, until 2008 for laboratory use?
And is the fact that they are planning to replace them not the same as admitting that they are dangerous, contrary to what they have always maintained hitherto?
So let us not lose sight of the fact that all those transgenic plants which it is intended to release into the environment and onto the markets carry these markers, which means that there are two conflicting truths, and where there are two conflicting truths, one is always a lie.
I am in no way opposed to science, but I am against reckless scientists whose thoughts are often of the gold mine of patents rather than the advance of knowledge.
Moreover, remember BSE.
Mr President, it will only become apparent in the distant future as to whether genetic modification is a blessing to humanity or a curse.
It was human beings that brought a plague of rabbits to America and Australian muskrats that undermine the Dutch dykes.
Subsequently, human beings saddled the world with chemical waste dumps and dumping sites for radioactive waste.
Recently, we have let an AIDS epidemic run riot and we have allowed mad cow disease to develop.
This has all come about owing to a combination of ignorance, impatience, laziness and pursuit of profit.
If we had known then what we know now, I am sure we would have done things differently.
If, before long, people start getting ill from consuming new products, existing plants and animals are supplanted by other species, and existing living beings are no longer resistant to new diseases, then we will know that we have made another big mistake.
So we have every reason to restrict our activities to scientific research for the time being, and to isolate all new products that emerge from this.
Unfortunately, we are now giving way to the pressure exerted by industry to permit commercial applications.
This is undoubtedly highly lucrative for these companies, but it will cost society as a whole enormously in the longer term.
It seems that the choice with regard to genetic modification is now between maintaining the old regulation, which is poor, but which does at least include a moratorium, and a new regulation, which is somewhat better but will abolish the moratorium.
I have noted that the actual choice cannot be made on the basis of this document.
Mr President, questions such as the presence of GMOs in our food and uncertainty about their effects on humans and on the environment are now in the public domain, and that is for the best.
In France, the press gave a great deal of coverage to the European Parliament vote on this directive at second reading.
French and European citizens alike are expecting the Members they elected to have a clear standpoint - the scandals involving contaminated blood and mad cow disease should give them a right to this, as if any justification were necessary.
Along with other Members, I believe that the findings of the Conciliation Committee fall far short of alleviating the concerns voiced by European society.
The notorious lack of any requirement for traceability is a source of provocation to all the people who wish, quite legitimately, to be kept informed.
Yet, the right to information is not always acknowledged.
The proposed regulations must guarantee the reliable labelling and traceability of GMOs and derived products.
In addition, we must ensure that those who produce and release GMOs are held responsible.
We must denounce the lobbying by unscrupulous laboratories and the multinational companies who represent them.
To sum up, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the final reading of the directive in order to highlight the responsibility of the Council, which failed to adopt all Parliament' s amendments after first reading which went in this direction and which would have produced a quite different text.
What is going to be adopted as the definitive text is in danger of completely invalidating the moratorium of June 1999, whereas the precautionary principle would instead put the lives and health of men and women before any other considerations, especially financial considerations.
Mr President, I would like first to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowe, and the members of the committee for their excellent and flexible cooperation during conciliation on such a complex piece of legislation.
We are now nearing the end of a long debate which started as long ago as December 1996 when the Commission presented the report on the review of Directive 90/220 concerning GMOs.
During that period the European public has become increasingly aware of the application of new technologies and has raised genuine and rightful concerns, in particular, with respect to the different ways that biotechnology can affect everyday life.
The Commission has no doubt that this piece of legislation responds to these concerns in a transparent and responsible manner and constitutes an important first milestone towards restoring public and market confidence.
During the debate, several Members of Parliament reminded the Commission of its intention to present appropriate proposals concerning traceability and labelling of GMOs and products derived from them.
The process has already started and I can confirm that the interservice consultation within the Commission on a draft proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning traceability and labelling of GMOs was launched yesterday and will be decided in the Commission at the beginning of March.
This proposal will, among other things, ensure that each consumer product which contains a GMO will be marked as such on the label.
It will also ensure that GMOs can be identified at all stages of the production chain.
It will allow control measures for withdrawal from the market in case of unforeseen events after placing on the market and appropriate labelling.
By June 2001 the Commission will present labelling proposals which are designed to give consumers more information about food derived from GMOs.
We are in particular considering moving away from the present approach of the DNA-protein criterion.
Such an approach will give consumers maximum choice between genetically modified and conventional products.
These proposals will include processed food in the labelling systems.
Finally, I will again reaffirm the Commission's intention to present before the end of the year, a proposal for a directive on environmental liability which will include GMOs.
As I said before, we are now approaching the end of a long debate concerning the revision of Directive 90/220.
This text already includes general legal obligations concerning traceability and labelling.
It will set the basic rules for an overall legislative framework in biotechnology.
It is therefore of the utmost importance that this directive is adopted now, paving the way towards a strict, transparent, efficient and predictable authorisation system for GMOs.
Mr President, after three years' work on this report it is difficult not to be a little emotional.
Having heard what has been said by my colleagues tonight, I want first of all to say how much I appreciate the kind words about the work I have done in the last three years and how delighted I am with the final outcome: a set of legislation which will provide the toughest laws on GMOs in the world.
There is no question that this House and the other European institutions will be taking their responsibilities to the people of Europe seriously when they approve this legislation tomorrow.
There is one point of confusion which I wish to clear up.
Many speakers have spoken about the problem of a moratorium.
This is an informal gentleman's agreement, as it is called, between the Commission and the Council.
Approving our legislation tomorrow will do nothing to lift this moratorium or change the situation with regard to the moratorium.
That is a decision that has to be taken between the Member States and the Commission.
What they do will decide what happens to the moratorium, not what we do tomorrow.
What we must do tomorrow is support this piece of legislation because without it we do not go forward, we go backwards.
Without it, we do not go forward into a strong regime of legislative control, we go backwards to the old directive, the discredited directive, which is of no use to any of us.
It has caused the Commission and the Council to halt the approval of GMOs and has caused this Parliament to work for nearly three years on replacing it.
We know very well that this is just the first step in the process.
There is other legislation under way.
We had the privilege - and I thank the Commission for this - of seeing its draft legislation, the regulation which has already today been passed for consultation within the Commission.
At first appearance, this document seems to be an important and very good step in the right direction and I am sure it is going to join the 92/20 revised directive within months as part of the legislative framework to control GMOs.
I can only say to the House that we must accept our responsibilities.
We must do what we have to do for the people of Europe and that is to support this piece of legislation tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Community Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2001) by Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council regulation allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco­management and audit scheme (EMAS)[C5-0661 - 1998/0303(COD)].
, rapporteur.
(ES) Mr President, almost eight years have gone by since the appearance, in June 1993, of the Community regulation allowing voluntary participation by companies in a Community eco-management and audit scheme.
This regulation, known by its acronym EMAS, opened up the use of market mechanisms in order for organisations to make a voluntary commitment to adopting a more pro-active approach to improving their environmental performance.
Its success depended largely on the concept thriving that the environment can and should be part of business strategies as another factor which, as well as environmental safety, provides added value for the business itself.
It represents a considerable change in mentality for the business world to consider respect for the environment more as a factor of competitiveness and progress, rather than as an annoying legal obligation, in many cases at heavy financial cost and with a questionable degree of appreciation of the effort on the part of consumers.
This revised and updated regulation makes an important contribution to a modern environmental policy, in accordance with the principles of sustainable development, important for real improvement in the environmental behaviour of companies and also for the recognition of this improvement by others, particularly by consumers.
During these eight years of practical application we have learnt various lessons.
The first is its use as a market tool.
Almost 3 100 industrial establishments across Europe have participated in this system, which is growing in numbers at a pace of nearly 50% per year.
Despite this significant development, there is still potential for progress.
The new regulation therefore incorporates several considerations facilitating participation by European companies in this environmental improvement system.
It is worth highlighting the extension of the scope of application to all types of organisations, including the service sector, and the possibility of incorporating public administration, establishing incentives and special consideration by public administrations for certified companies when awarding public contracts, encouraging participation among small- and medium-sized enterprises, coordination between the European system and other international environmental certification systems.
In this last aspect there has been considerable simplification and unification of nomenclature and requirements, which will provide significant clarification of the role that EMAS should play in the European context.
Another of the lessons that we have learnt is the need to maintain and even increase the credibility of the system.
This text has stepped up measures to ensure its quality and credibility, as well as public access to information.
The role of the environmental statement is increasing, as is the work of the environmental verifiers, who have to check that organisations are complying with the requirements of this regulation.
These requirements have also been strengthened by Parliament' s amendments, of which the following stand out: the obligation to comply with environmental legislation by participating companies, establishing more demanding standards for the qualification and training of the environmental verifiers who accredit the companies, public reports on the environmental performance of companies, with absolute credibility for third parties, greater involvement of the interested parties in the process of monitoring the environmental performance of companies and, in particular, of employees and users, extension of environmental responsibility, which goes beyond the company' s facilities, to include indicators of the performance of products and services, in line with the approach of the new environmental directives, and also an increase in the role of the coordinating bodies with the aim of facilitating the homogenous application of the system in the various Member States.
In order to arrive at the results that I have just mentioned, I have to say that the conciliation procedure was extremely positive and interesting.
We arrived at it with 24 amendments, of which only 4 were accepted without change and 3 were withdrawn in the course of the negotiations.
20 amendments were accepted on the basis of compromise formulations, which gives an idea of the intensity and the success of the negotiations.
I would therefore like to thank the experts from Parliament, the Commission and the Council for the work that they did during that period, and the members of the Conciliation Committee for being willing to make a decided effort to strengthen this directive.
I think that the European Parliament can consider the final result of the conciliation to be very satisfactory, given that the large majority of its amendments have been incorporated fully or in revised form into the joint text, and I therefore propose that it be approved tomorrow in Parliament at third reading.
Mr President, the rapporteur has already explained that the European Parliament helped to get EMAS II, as it is referred to, framed more strictly and not watered down too much; she also explained that the Conciliation Committee refused to give ground and did not deviate from the fundamental requirements for this voluntary eco-audit system.
It is precisely because this is a voluntary eco-audit system that we need to give it credibility and we have succeeded in achieving this in our dealings with the Council.
I believe a basic requirement of EMAS II is to ensure that existing environmental legislation is respected.
It would have been a disgrace if this principle had been dropped at third reading.
We have also succeeded in achieving greater transparency, that is improved information for the public and other stakeholders.
My group also thought it was very important for employees and their representatives to be actively involved in the organisation.
There has been a great deal of discussion about this request, and it is evident that the somewhat more complicated wording now found in the text is more to the liking of those representing the Council than the very clear requirement which the European Parliament had originally formulated.
My group is nevertheless satisfied, and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I would like to emphasise once again that both legal compliance and the involvement of employees and those representing them are important for EMAS, and I await the Commission's assessment with bated breath.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on producing a result that is good for Parliament.
I also think it very important that the whole basis for working has been the notion that first we have to endorse current legislation and then these voluntary agreements can be made in addition.
In fact, working on this basis we could imagine too that in the future new agreements could be made with companies.
We must clearly define those areas in which we should try to achieve important goals as far as the environment is concerned faster and perhaps more effectively, within the framework of legislation.
This proposal is now extending the system that has been in force since 1993 by including various organisations having environmental impacts.
We are no longer just speaking about industrial companies, which is good.
Pro-active participation in matters of the environment is important not only for the environment but also for businesses themselves.
The present-day consumer is laying ever greater emphasis on the environmental impact of products when they make spending decisions.
It has been quite rightly said that for this system to be implemented effectively it will take commitment on the part of staff to common values.
This in turn will require employees to be properly informed, but they must also be given the opportunity to make their own contribution to the development of environmentally friendly action.
It is inevitable that joining an eco-management scheme will require a commitment to making regular environment-related declarations and reports, substantiated by independent experts, and to making them public.
I believe that we are all very pleased that the EMAS regulation which the Commission proposed in October 1998 is now entering the final stage of its adoption.
The EMAS regulation which you are considering will set up a solid environmental management system capable of allowing organisations in many activity sectors to have a better environmental performance.
It will provide an appropriate answer to the necessity of making both private and public sectors aware of their responsibilities towards our environment on which their activities have an impact.
Last, but not least, the EMAS regulation will lead to the disclosure of reliable environmental information and provide for interaction between different interest groups.
This will be an important step in helping to build a bridge between economic operators and public authorities on the one hand, and citizens on the other.
It is therefore with great pleasure that I welcome the agreement on a joint text reached on 22 November 2000 by the Conciliation Committee.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo, as well as all the members of the parliamentary delegation and the Conciliation Committee.
Allow me also to hope that European institutions will set an example to contribute to the development of EMAS by applying it themselves.
This will be good for the environment and beneficial to the credibility of the European institutions.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

The next item is the report (A5-0025/2001) by Mrs Müller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements [COM(2000) 222 - C5-0234/2000 - 2000/0080(COD)].
Mr President, I would ask permission to speak regarding the Rules of Procedure.
The proposal for a directive which is being debated ought to be rejected pursuant to Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure which specifies that, at the beginning of the debate on a specific item on the agenda, its inadmissibility may formally be moved.
I am making such a proposal, and the reason why I think the proposal for a directive ought to be considered inadmissible is that it is, in my view, contrary to the Treaty.
It is contrary to Article 152 of the Treaty, relating to public health, and there is no doubt that this proposal for a directive is entirely motivated by a concern to protect public health.
Article 152 specifies that incentive measures may be taken, but excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States.
The proposal in question provides for a particularly intensive harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States and is therefore contrary to Article 152.
I searched the Commission' s proposal and Mrs Müller' s report in vain for a discussion of this question of where authority lies.
I think the debate should be considered inadmissible until it has been clarified that the problem of authority is in order, and I would request that a vote be taken.
Does anyone wish to speak for the motion?
Mr President, I should like to speak in favour of the proposal, for it must stand to reason that Parliament has to keep to the basis of the Treaty.
If there is the slightest suspicion that Parliament is not complying with the basis of the Treaty, then negotiations should be suspended until the matter has been clarified.
Does anyone wish to speak against the motion to consider the report unacceptable?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission presents a proposal for a directive to us, I naturally assume that it is legally in order.
That is one of the reasons why I was appointed rapporteur.
I believe that there can be no question of our not voting on this directive.
We have heard one speech for the motion and one against.
For the sake of clarity: if you vote for this motion, you consider this report unacceptable. If you vote against the motion, you consider it acceptable and we will therefore proceed to the debate.
Mr President, with an issue of this importance it is necessary that we indicate to those still on the premises that a vote is taking place.
It is very unusual for a vote to be called in this way with about 12 Members in the House.
Many others outside are completely unaware - as are those of us who are here who happen to wish to speak in this debate - that this issue is being considered.
If there is a way in which you can alert those on the premises of Parliament to that fact that there is a vote and adjourn until they are present, maybe we will get a more representative result.
Mr President, it is highly irregular that people are behaving so undemocratically as to continue to make comments during the vote, and secondly, we have now voted.
It is for you to announce the result of the vote, and then we will simply carry on with the debate.
I believe that is the only way, and the best way, to deal with a topic that we have already spoken about on so many occasions before.
(Parliament rejected the motion)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about food supplements, we chiefly mean vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids and certain other substances.
So we are not talking about enriched food, nor about food additives.
We are talking about concentrated sources of nutrients supplied either individually or combined in the form of capsules, tablets, powder or similar presentations.
Vitamins and minerals are involved in many biochemical processes in the human body.
An optimal supply of these substances is vital for human health and performance.
I regard it as being very positive that we can enrich our daily intake of food with vitamins and minerals.
This directive on food supplements provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States.
Some Member States currently classify food supplements as food, and others as medicines.
The directive clearly classifies them as food products, which creates a level playing field for manufacturers and also removes existing barriers to trade within the single market.
At the same time, we are establishing legal certainty for European consumers.
The Commission' s proposal is therefore basically to be welcomed.
However, discussions in Parliament have made it clear that certain parts of the proposal need to be modified.
I particularly wish to highlight the area of application.
The Commission's proposal for a directive adopts a rather narrow approach as regards the substances it covers.
This applies firstly to permitted minerals and their compounds.
Some important minerals are not covered by the Commission proposal, despite their being used in many EU countries.
These minerals should be accepted as a matter of principle.
Of course chemical compounds still need to be submitted to scientific tests.
This needs to be done before the directive enters into force, in order to avoid important food supplements having to be withdrawn from the market.
In addition to vitamins and minerals, there are also other substances covered by the term "food supplements".
But we should not overreach ourselves and try to regulate everything in one go as regards food supplements on the market.
There is a consensus that other substances besides vitamins and minerals need to be subjected to scientific tests before they are covered by the directive.
Nevertheless, defining these additional substances using the heading "physiological" brings with it new problems as regards classification as medicinal products or drugs, and would totally confuse the market situation, which is quite contrary to the aim of the directive.
Blurring the dividing line between medicines and food supplements would lead to a lack of clarity as regards health-related claims, which have not so far been regulated.
Surely none of this can be the objective of this directive on food supplements.
As regards dosage and thus consumers' health, the system of safe maximum amounts is to be welcomed.
Nevertheless, we also need to ensure that consumers do not run the risk of substantially exceeding the daily requirement of food supplements when they take a daily vitamin tablet.
With vitamins A, D, and B6, for example, there would be a health risk.
The Commission proposal clearly covers this.
I totally support this.
With regard to food supplement labelling, the proposal for a directive provides for clear consumer information.
Labelling should tell consumers how to use vitamin and mineral products correctly.
Products are required to meet the highest purity and quality standards.
Both individual substances and the final product have to be produced in accordance with good manufacturing practice.
A compulsory notification procedure is essential in order to guarantee minimum levels of official control.
Above all, notification is only meaningful if a uniform procedure applies to all Member States.
This directive will provide European consumers with a common legal framework which places great value on product safety and helpful labelling without limiting the range of products on the shelves. In other words, it provides a legal framework guaranteeing the free movement of goods whilst simultaneously ensuring a high level of protection.
Finally, I would like to very warmly thank the shadow rapporteur for working with me in such a cooperative way.
Many thanks, Mrs Corbey.
Mr President, we are discussing a very important directive today.
The market for food supplements is developing apace.
This has to do with people' s lifestyles and eating habits.
It also has to do with consumers' insecurity about their own health.
People' s health is a matter of the utmost concern.
Food supplements can be an aid to health, so those who can afford it will gladly buy themselves good health.
But we must also be aware that it is easy to talk people who are insecure into feeling that they must buy themselves good health, and that quality is not always guaranteed.
We must therefore separate the wheat from the chaff.
The consumer is entitled to safe products and sound information.
There are major industrial interests at stake when it comes to food supplements.
There is no internal market but there are numerous rules at national level.
This is inconvenient, but as the PSE Group sees it, consumer protection must take precedence at the end of the day.
Divergent national provisions, uncertainty as to the safety of products and a growing market clearly demonstrate the urgent need for a European directive on food supplements.
That is why the Commission's proposal is so important.
The Commission has established a clear basis for determining safe upper limits of vitamins and minerals.
I am pleased to compliment Mrs Müller on her consistent, professional and serious approach.
On behalf of the PSE Group, I would like to broach three subjects.
Firstly, the scope of the directive.
The Commission has proposed that only vitamins and minerals should be brought within the scope of application of the proposal.
That is understandable but it fails to take into account how the industry has grown.
Herbal extracts, amino acids, and essential fatty acids are used in food supplements too.
I personally think it is important to define the scope as broadly as possible, thus including substances with a nutritional and a physiological function alike.
The advantage of this broad definition is that it creates legal certainty for producers and gives consumers a wide choice of safe products.
The second point I would like to address is the need for scientific testing.
Far and away the most important aspect of this proposal is the principle that only ingredients that have been scientifically tested are permissible.
The maximum permitted quantities are determined according to the basic principles laid down in Article 5.
That is the basis for consumer confidence.
Naturally, any country may decide for itself whether or not to permit untested ingredients.
The directive does not detract from this in any way.
But it is unacceptable, to my mind, for them to enter into circulation in the internal market without so much as a by your leave.
Scientific research and approval are required for that to happen.
Lastly, a few words about labelling.
It is very important for the information to be correct and to include a warning about exceeding the dosage.
A good diet is crucial and is an aid to good health.
No consumer should be put to great expense as a result of misrepresentation and no consumer should feel obliged to buy good health.
All in all, I think it is a marvellous proposal.
Once again, my sincere thanks to the rapporteur.
We support this report wholeheartedly, subject to guarantees that ingredients are scientifically tested.
Mr President, in 1999, the turnover in the European Union for vitamins and minerals alone was over EUR 1 600 million, even without taking other food supplements into account.
That just shows how fashionable these products have become, which is quite natural, when all is said and done.
The wish to be and to stay healthy is probably the most widely shared one.
Every day, then, millions of European citizens take thousands of pills, capsules and tablets.
It also shows how urgent is the need for regulation of this market in Europe, a market which is expanding rapidly, lacks transparency, and, above all, varies greatly from one Member State to another, as has been noted.
The differences are sometimes quite considerable and concern areas such as product composition, dosage, and criteria relating to purity, labelling or the required approval procedure.
We must, therefore, fill these gaps so that we can protect consumers, so that they are extremely well briefed and as clearly informed as is possible, while enabling the free movement of goods within the European Union, as, I am sure, everyone will agree.
When voting on Mrs Müller' s excellent report, on which we must congratulate her, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy included vitamins and minerals in the definition of food supplements, as well as other substances listed in the annexes.
We welcome this contribution.
Our aim was to ensure that, in the long term, the directive would cover all the food supplements already on the European market, so that European consumers can enjoy the same safety guarantees.
In the same spirit, our group tabled three additional amendments, Amendments Nos 33, 34 and 35. Amendments with the same effect were also tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, seeking to ensure that the scope of the directive includes substances that have physiological effects, i.e. non-nutritional substances which are nonetheless vital to a person' s well-being.
Fibre, which is known to aid digestion, in the same way as plant extracts, is included.
I would like to point out that this proposal was already included in the text of the French Presidency and is currently in that of the Swedish Presidency.
The very reason that we are here today is to create a legal framework in order to harmonise the sale of these food supplements.
We should not create a legal void in Europe with regard to ingredients which have physiological functions.
There are millions of consumers who would find that incomprehensible.
Mr President, I very much welcome the guiding principles of this directive, namely the safety of the consumer and the single market.
The basic underlying food-safety legislation is that safety should be established on the basis of scientific risk assessment and that consumers should be able to purchase products of their choice provided that they are safe.
It is important that safety criteria form the basis of the directive, rather than arbitrary recommended daily allowances which would be unnecessarily restrictive and not related to safety.
In the UK and Ireland we indeed have a liberal regime and consumers there do not want their rights restricted.
Most vitamins and minerals have a clear nutritional function; other ingredients commonly included in supplements are not nutrients and do not therefore have a nutritional function but do have physiological function.
The definition of a food supplement in the directive should reflect all supplements.
If products are now excluded from the general definition, there is a danger that such products will in the future fall outside the scope of the legislation and remain unregulated.
I very much recommend that you take on board the physiological function which unfortunately the rapporteur - and I do not agree with her - asked to be excluded from the report.
Mr President, in connection with Parliament' s debate on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws relating to food supplements, I have received hundreds of approaches in the form of approximately 500 signatures by way of protest and a long list of detailed e-mails and letters from ordinary, concerned Danes and from professionals who are nervous that their access to food supplements might be limited.
I assume that it is not only Danish consumers who are expressing this great interest in the directive.
Those who have approached me have all pointed out that a number of experts have placed many question marks over those investigations showing that vitamins C, E and A in particular may be dangerous in too high doses, and that alternative investigations seem specifically to show that high doses of these vitamins have had positive effects free from side effects.
Claim and counter-claim, then.
Because the need for vitamins depends upon a long list of factors which differ from one Member State to another, such as climate and which vitamins are present in the traditional food, the question arises of whether this area is at all suited to EU harmonisation.
Ole Krarup also sowed the seeds of doubt about the legal basis.
When these differences are taken into account and the major interest of consumers taken seriously, my conclusion is that a vote against the proposal for a directive is called for.
Laws governing food supplements ought to be established at national level where both the individual consumer and the non-governmental organisations have a much greater opportunity to have their views heard and considered and where, therefore, the legislators also have a better opportunity to assess the different positions.
Mr President, I am sorry that most of those who sought to stop this debate did not bother to stay to hear it.
I compliment the rapporteur on her report and all the work she has put in.
Food supplements can be a tonic or a health aid.
In rare cases the nature of the supplement or the nature of an individual mean that too great a dosage could be harmful, and so, for generations, we and other countries have set safe upper limits.
With these and with proper labelling the consumer can exercise a safe, free and informed choice.
In Britain, Ireland and elsewhere we have not gone down the route of some of our fellow Member States, which is to take the recommended minimum daily allowance that was set by the American Government in 1943 to ensure that GIs serving in Europe did not suffer from scurvy and beri beri, and to treat that as the basis for maximum intake before classification as a pharmaceutical.
We fear that route leads to higher costs to consumers or an incentive to use unregulated foreign suppliers.
Our belief is that the two systems can coexist.
That is the purpose of Amendment No 50, in my name and that of Mrs Doyle and others.
It allows the RDA to be taken into account when it is close to the upper safety limit.
I believe that the positive list, as it stands, is far too limited.
We should at the very least expand it by the amendments to this effect.
Labelling must allow for accurate health messages, such as for folic acid.
Lastly, I support the reinstatement of the word "physiological" alongside "nutritional", as otherwise a significant number of items on sale and acceptable today could risk being banned.
It was a word included, I believe, at the behest of the Council's working party of experts.
Folic acid is an example.
These are not just my views and those of my delegation.
They are the views of the British Labour Government and, more importantly, the views of the new UK Food Standards Agency.
Mr President, I am glad to be able to follow someone who has so vigorously supported the Labour Government, as Mr Bowis just did.
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur after the sometimes stormy passage of her report and the mini-ambush which she almost suffered tonight.
In the UK we are the largest manufacturer - and indeed consumer - of health supplements of one kind or another, vitamin and mineral supplements to the diet.
We have been stringent in ensuring that false claims are never made for them, and that is why in the UK they have never been marketed as medicines.
But they do bring benefits to millions who would accept that they are a supplement to, but not a substitute for, a balanced diet.
We believe that the upper safe levels are sufficient to make the difference between foods and medicines even clearer.
Obviously the situation is different in some other Member States, and any attempt to regularise the position makes sense in the general context of emergent food law.
I support the rapporteur's view that all substances which have been validly in use in the Member States, according to the laws of those countries, should continue until such time as they can be tested and perhaps found wanting.
I rather doubt if many will be, and I do not think that the annexes themselves contain anything like the number of exceptions that we should see.
With every day that passes, we hear of other substances which are causing concern because they may be excluded.
That is why the word physiological - and I would beg the rapporteur to think again even at this late hour - is important in terms of people who are genuine sufferers and who derive great benefit from these products.
We ought to hear from the Commissioner tonight that there will be measured progress towards effective analysis by the requisite deadline, be that 2004 or later.
Effective labelling, so that the consumers can choose both the context and the regularity of what they are getting, is the best way forward.
That will help many consumers and worry none.
Mr President, I would like to support my colleague Nuala Ahern's comments that physiological products should of course also be included.
However, I welcome the fact that vitamins and minerals are classified as food products, as I believe that we should give responsible consumers the option of using them.
But I also believe that the Commission should be asking why food products are losing so much of their vitamin content, for example why broccoli has lost 80% of its vitamin content over the last 10 years.
I would like to make a particular appeal for labelling not just of ingredients but also of production methods.
There are vitamins which if naturally produced are more effective then when they are synthetically produced.
I believe that consumers also have the right to know whether or not they have been produced using genetic engineering.
I would like to pick up one last point relating to what Mrs Sandbæk said.
I particularly wish to call on the Commission to make sure that this report is not misused to support "functional" foods, because I agree with Mrs Sandbæk that traditional foods should not be artificially enriched with added vitamins.
But I wish to stress that we welcome consumers being given the option of taking additional vitamins.
